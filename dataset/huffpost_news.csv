monday forcefully rejected former president s efforts to get his federal election interference case thrown out in a series of court filings monday trump who has denied wrongdoing has sought to get the four criminal charges he faces for his scheme to undo s win in the 2020 presidential contest dismissed using various legal arguments the trial has been scheduled for march james pearce a prosecutor for smith took issue with the former president s claim that the case should be dismissed on constitutional and statutory grounds calling his challenges meritless pearce wrote in a 79 page filing the defendant attempts to rewrite the indictment claiming that it charges him with wholly innocuous perhaps even admirable conduct sharing his opinions about election fraud and seeking election integrity when in fact it clearly describes the defendant s fraudulent use of knowingly false statements as weapons in furtherance of his criminal plans specifically one of trump s arguments has been that the first amendment protects his election falsehoods the first amendment does not protect fraudulent speech or speech otherwise integral to criminal conduct particularly crimes that attack the integrity and proper function of government processes the prosecutor said pearce added that trump s claim that smith has failed to allege deceit because none of the public officials his lies were targeted at would have been fooled by his words are misguided were it otherwise defendants captured en route to a bank robbery could not be charged with conspiracy because their crime did not succeed indeed a conspiracy can be committed even if the object of the conspiracy is unattainable pearce said in his effort to avoid potential accountability for his jan 6 actions trump s team claimed he was singled out even though he is far from the first candidate to work with others to suggest an alternate slate of electors they specifically cited what they described as similar efforts by candidates in seven u s elections ranging from 1800 to 2016 president trump is the first person to face criminal charges for such core political behavior as disputing the outcome of an election his lawyers said but prosecutors disagreed saying prior electoral disputes in the history of the u s cannot justify trump s corrupt conduct notably absent from any of these historical episodes however is any attempt by any person to use fraud and deceit to obstruct or defeat the governmental function that would result in the certification of the lawful winner of a presidential election prosecutors said meanwhile in another motion prosecutors tackled trump s attempt to remove allegations regarding his actions leading up to the jan 6 2021 insurrection from the indictment prosecutors said while trump is trying to evade responsibility for the capitol riot he did nothing to deter his supporters from storming the building and tried to leverage their actions by further obstructing the certification of the 2020 election result indeed that day was the culmination of the defendant s criminal conspiracies to overturn the legitimate results of the presidential election when the defendant directed a large and angry crowd one that he had summoned to washington dc and fueled with knowingly false claims of election fraud to the capitol to obstruct the congressional certification proceeding molly gaston a member of smith s team wrote the special counsel s office also contested trump s claims of selective and vindictive prosecution saying the former president s arguments are based on nothing more than spurious allegations contrived from two newspaper articles citing anonymous sources they add that while trump claims he is singled out the events he is alleged to have taken part in are quite extraordinary if the defendant is correct in his claim that the indictment is unprecedented it is only because the defendant s conduct is unprecedented prosecutor thomas windom said trump had previously tried to get the charges dismissed citing presidential immunity judge tanya chutkan has yet to rule on that motion apart from this case the former president has been indicted for his efforts to undo the 2020 election in georgia his alleged mishandling of classified documents after leaving the white house and his role in a hush money payment scheme involving adult film actress

year contests but this year s races are stacked with insights for 2024 s presidential election and the looming battle for control of congress indicating for example whether suburban swing voters will be moved by attempts to restrict abortion access and whether a pair of southern state democrats can outrun an unpopular president abortion access is the throughline for many of these races democrats encouraged by a for abortion rights since the supreme court overturned roe v wade in june 2022 made local races in kentucky mississippi and virginia about abortion access in mississippi democrats are also calling for medicaid expansion to shore up a failing rural hospital system while republicans there and elsewhere in the country seek to make the election a referendum on president joe biden whom a showed losing to former president donald trump in five key battlegrounds here are the races including a hotly contested school board race in virginia and a countywide contest in a pennsylvania swing county that are worth watching on tuesday more than other off year contests virginia s legislative races are a bellwether for 2024 after trending blue for the last decade virginia took a sharp right turn in 2021 electing a republican governor lieutenant governor and attorney general all in the same year and flipping the lower legislative chamber the house of delegates republicans want to finish what they started keeping their slim house majority and gaining control of the virginia senate republicans need to flip just two state senate seats to establish an evenly divided upper chamber in which case lt gov winsome earle sears a republican would act as the tie breaking vote a republican majority would give gov glenn youngkin r the ability to enact a legislative agenda that includes the passage of a 15 week abortion ban that s of particular concern to democrats who fear losing the last point of access for abortion across the south the road to controlling the legislature runs through virginia s heavily contested suburbs where the swing voters who propelled youngkin s 2021 victory presaged democrats losing the u s house a year later the result has been wall to wall advertising from national groups on both sides who seek not only control of the legislature but the momentum boost heading into 2024 the races to watch here extend far down the ballot too in loudoun county a wealthy suburb of washington d c conservatives are trying to take over a school board governing a district known for elite schools because they don t like how racism and history are being taught in classrooms it s more proof that school board wars over so called critical race theory are still raging around the country incumbent gov andy beshear d is fending off a challenge from republican attorney general daniel cameron in kentucky where trump won by 26 points in 2020 the math here is stacked against any democrat even a popular governor who is well liked among republicans polls nonetheless show beshear with an edge making kentucky s gubernatorial election a true nail biter a beshear win would provide democrats with some hope they can carry conservative southern states even if beshear is something of an anomaly as the son of a popular former governor steve beshear he has name recognition and generational goodwill that is hard to replicate a win for cameron on the other hand will mean he becomes the country s first black republican elected since reconstruction instantly elevating his national profile cameron and national republicans have tried to yoke beshear to president joe biden whose job approval in the state is deep underwater while beshear has tried to keep the focus on local issues like his handling of a series of devastating natural disasters to hear democrats tell it the race is a referendum too on kentucky s ultra restrictive abortion law which does not include exceptions for rape and incest cameron who is staunchly anti choice has waffled on whether he would sign a bill establishing exceptions beshear who supports reasonable restrictions on the procedure as well as amending the state s abortion law to include exceptions has held cameron s feet to the flames on abortion running ads highlighting the attorney general s anti choice stance and pushing him on it during debates mississippi is one of the most conservative states in the country and has not had a democratic governor in 20 years public service commissioner brandon presley a socially conservative populist and cousin to rock n roll pioneer elvis hopes to change that by unseating mississippi gov tate reeves r on tuesday two key factors have democrats expressing cautious optimism about presley s chances the financial crisis facing many of the state s rural hospitals has increased scrutiny of reeves decision not to accept federal affordable care act funds to expand medicaid coverage for working poor adults the policy has deep bipartisan support and has helped presley pick up some important republican endorsements in addition reeves is tainted by his connections to the largest public corruption scandal in state history which involved the plundering of 77 million in temporary assistance for needy families tanf funds for the pet projects of well connected mississippians like former nfl star brett favre presley has scorched reeves in particular for firing a special attorney investigating the scandal as the attorney began to pursue senior republicans like former gov phil bryant reeves who was lieutenant governor when the welfare scheme first surfaced notes that the scandal preceded his time as governor and claims that he fired the attorney because the state needed a law firm with more resources to run the investigation the democratic governors association has given presley 3 7 million and some polls show a close race but there s no question that presley is the underdog the state s electorate which is about 35 to 40 black is polarized along racial lines in recent elections only extraordinary democrats running statewide have been capable of getting more than one quarter of the white vote presley who has a base among conservative white voters in northern mississippi and also worked hard to court black voters needs very high black turnout to win in the homestretch reeves has leaned hard into partisan appeals hammering presley as a closet liberal and reminding voters that he is part of the same party as biden who is deeply unpopular in the state reeves also trotted out trump s endorsement last wednesday in a television ad ohioans will vote on two ballot measures that may challenge the conventional wisdom about how conservative the buckeye state has become in the age of trump at the forefront is issue 1 which seeks to codify protections for abortion rights in the state constitution superseding a six week ban that republican lawmakers had sought to enact that s been tied up in the courts issue 1 would make abortion legal up to the point of fetal viability at around 24 weeks whereas current ohio law allows abortion through 22 weeks of pregnancy it s the only abortion measure that voters are deciding on directly in 2023 meaning it s a critical bellwether for how abortion issues will be framed to voters next year the pro choice side had an early victory in august when it defeated a gop led measure that would have made it harder to get a citizen led amendment before voters but given the inconclusive public polling neither side is heading into tuesday assured of a win issue 2 seeks to legalize recreational marijuana the outcome will show how far ohio voters have come on marijuana legalization after rejecting a similar measure in 2015 its passage would make ohio the 24th state to legalize recreational marijuana joining missouri and montana as conservative states where weed is fully legal republican officials are broadly against issue 2 passing a resolution in the state senate backing a no vote on the measure gov mike dewine r said weed legalization would hurt residents i don t think the little bit of money this will generate to the state of ohio is worth the damage to the people of ohio dewine said last month

dollars in support of republican candidate carolyn carluccio a judge in montgomery county a narrower democratic majority could cause heartburn in liberal ranks ahead of the 2024 presidential election democrats advantage on the high court enabled them to reject gop challenges to the 2020 presidential election results and in 2022 to select the state s new congressional maps amid an impasse between democratic gov tom wolf and the gop controlled state legislature in southwestern pennsylvania the allegheny county executive race could also have implications for the 2024 election results democrat sara innamorato a former state representative is the favorite to win the race to lead the state s second most populous county which encompasses the city of pittsburgh and its suburbs and which biden

chief of Ukraine’s Armed Forces had previously suggested a significant breakthrough in the fight against Russia is unlikely.,Marita Vlachou,2023-11-06 00:00:00,while the eyes of the world are affixed on the middle east and the ongoing war between israel and hamas another high stakes conflict is still going on in eastern europe between russia and ukraine valerii zaluzhnyi the commander in chief of ukraine s armed forces last week his country has reached a stalemate about five months after it started a counteroffensive in the south against moscow s forces in an apparent downbeat assessment of ukraine s ability to score significant progress against russia just like in the first world war we have reached the level of technology that puts us into a stalemate zaluzhnyi said there will most likely be no deep and beautiful breakthrough he continued but ukrainian president volodymyr zelenskyy rejected that suggestion in an sunday while recognizing the challenges ahead the situation is difficult he said through a translator i don t think that this is a stalemate zelenskyy said that while early on in the war many expected his country to be crushed by russia ukraine has continued fighting for nearly two years they thought that they would checkmate us but this didn t happen he added in his interview with the economist zaluzhnyi argued that within four months ukrainian forces should have managed to reach crimea and fight there but that hasn t happened zaluzhnyi cited the ability of modern weapons to pick up a high concentration of troops meaning that both ukraine and russia can identify each other s movements as one of the reasons for the so called impasse in order for us to break this deadlock we need something new like the gunpowder which the chinese invented and which we are still using to kill each other he said joanna szostek an associate fellow at chatham house and associate professor at the university of glasgow sought to explain the perceived differences in messaging while noting that both zaluzhnyi and zelenskyy are still in agreement over the need for ukraine to keep fighting zaluzhnyi s motivation seems to be almost presenting a list of what ukraine needs to change the direction of the war and to get back to a position where regaining territory is possible szostek told huffpost zelenskyy i think is perhaps more concerned about keeping up morale and sort of keeping a more positive sort of spin on things szostek continued adding that zelenskyy is in march which could help explain his position liana fix a fellow for europe at the council on foreign relations told huffpost that talk of a stalemate in the battlefield could raise questions in the particularly from who oppose more support for kyiv fix added that the admission of an absence of a major breakthrough could also raise concerns about the west s strategy and the endgame in ukraine at quite a bad timing as zelenskyy eagerly awaits more aid from washington asked if ukraine is planning on shifting its war strategy to try to gain the upper hand in the fight zelenskyy said his military is coming up with several different plans but that they need more weapons but the u s one of the country s biggest backers and more specifically congress has so far been unable to agree on a package while president made a joint request for over 100 billion to provide more u s support to ukraine israel and other allies house republicans appear to have a different course of action in mind newly elected house speaker mike johnson r la has called on the senate to pass a standalone bill which covers support just for israel he said he to now bring a ukraine aid package to the floor which however will also have to include funds for tighter border measures in the u s a gop priority johnson in recent weeks has appeared to voice more support for the war torn country we can t allow vladimir putin to prevail in ukraine because i don t believe it would stop there and it would probably encourage and empower china to perhaps make a move on taiwan he late last month meanwhile ukraine s ambassador to the u s oksana markarova told cbs s face the nation russia has also been supporting hamas as well as iran which is thought to have ties to the militant group as it fights israel markarova called on both u s officials and the wider world to not lose sight of the importance of both conflicts we just have to understand that this war on terror have to be won everywhere and that we cannot afford to lose focus in one place or another markarova said that s why in order to be able to stop not only russia but other terroristic regimes we also have to win in ukraine zelenskyy time magazine last week that putin is enjoying the fact that the world is focused on israel of course we lose out from the events in the middle east he said people are dying and the world s help is needed there to save lives to save humanity as the war drags on it is that support among the u s public for continued aid for ukraine is also coming down while ukraine was hopeful of making gains through its counteroffensive zelenskyy has the operation has been slower than desired the ukrainian president has the lack of a big breakthrough to the fact that his country s forces delayed their operation due to a lack of munitions allowing russia to better prepare to respond to it over the weekend nbc news that u s and european officials have started talking to the ukrainian government about the potential terms of a peace deal including about the concessions kyiv could have to make according to two sources during his interview on meet the press while zelenskyy did not directly weigh into whether he has engaged in such talks he said russia has not shown to be trustworthy and that no potential peace negotiations between the two sides can take place until russian forces are off ukrainian territory i m not ready to speak with the terrorists because their word is nothing nothing zelenskyy said we can t trust terrorists because terrorists always come back fix told huffpost now would be the wrong time to push ukraine to the negotiating table because pessimism about kyiv s counteroffensive could mean it would be engaging in talks from a weak position moscow appears to be pleased with the current state of the conflict fix noted for russia the equation has changed she said i mean at the beginning when they were on the offensive they had to show successes but now it is efficient for russia to hold the line

SISAK, JENNIFER PELTZ, ERIC TUCKER",2023-11-06 00:00:00,new york ap former president vigorously defended his wealth and business on monday tangling from the witness stand with the judge overseeing his and denouncing as a political witch hunt a lawsuit accusing him of dramatically inflating his net worth trump s long awaited testimony about property valuations and financial statements was punctuated by personal jabs at a judge he said was biased against him and at the new york attorney general whom he derided as a political hack he proudly boasted of his real estate business i m worth billions of dollars more than the financial statements and disputed claims that he had deceived banks and insurers this is the opposite of fraud he declared referring to new york attorney general letitia james a democrat whose office brought the lawsuit he said the fraud is her the testy exchanges and frequent rebukes from the judge underscored trump s unwillingness to adapt his famously freewheeling rhetorical style to a formal courtroom setting governed by rules of evidence and legal protocol but while his presence on the stand was a vivid reminder of the legal troubles he faces as he vies to reclaim the white house in 2024 it also functioned as a campaign platform for the former president and leading republican presidential candidate to raise anew to supporters his claims of political persecution at the hands of government lawyers and judges people are sick and tired of what s happening i think it is a very sad say for america trump told reporters outside the courtroom after roughly three and a half hours on the stand trump s testimony got off to a contentious start monday with state judge arthur engoron admonishing him to keep his answers concise and reminding him that this is not a political rally turning to trump s attorney at one point the judge said i beseech you to control him if you can if you can t i will the civil trial is one of numerous legal proceedings trump is confronting including federal and state charges accusing him of crimes and scheming to his legal and political strategies have now become completely intertwined as he hopscotches between campaign events and court hearings a schedule that will only intensify once his criminal trials begin though the fraud case doesn t carry the prospect of prison as the criminal prosecutions do its allegations of financial impropriety cut to the heart of the brand he spent decades crafting the suggestion that trump is worth less than he s claimed has been interpreted by him as a cutting insult i m worth billions of dollars more than the financial statements he said telling a state lawyer you go around and try and demean me and try and hurt me probably for political reasons the courtroom at 60 centre st has become a familiar destination for trump he has spent hours over the past month voluntarily seated at the defense table he took the stand previously unexpectedly and briefly after he was he denied violating the rules but engoron disagreed and fined him anyway his turn as a witness gave him the biggest opportunity yet to respond to allegations against him summoned by lawyers for the state trump repeatedly balked at the suggestion that he had ever intended to defraud financial institutions he said that he d been misquoted or taken too literally in past public comments about his business dealings and his florida estate mar a lago and that disclaimers in his financial statements covered any missteps and he returned to a familiar position that no one had been victimized not one bank lost money not one insurance company lost money and the insurance company that you said lost is still my insurance company he said they re one of the biggest insurance companies in the world and they don t know what you re talking about tensions between engoron and trump already on display in recent weeks when the judge fined him a total of 15 000 for incendiary outside of court comments were evident early on monday when the ex president was repeatedly scolded about the length and content of his answers engoron while building the real estate empire that catapulted him to fame will decide the non jury case he cautioned at one point that he was prepared to draw negative inferences against the former president if he failed to rein in his answers i do not want to hear everything this witness has to say he has a lot to say that has nothing to do with the case or the questions the judge said mr kise can you control your client engoron told trump lawyer christopher kise who himself has clashed with the judge kise responded trump was entitled to latitude as a former president and current candidate taking time away from campaigning to testify despite the testy back and forth early in the day trump was later able to veer into expansive answers without anyone cutting him off using the opportunity to rail against james the judge and the proceedings in general i think that she s a political hack and i think she used this case to try and become governor and she used it successfully to become attorney general i think it s a disgrace that this case is going on trump said of engoron trump said he ruled against me and he said i was a fraud before he knew anything about me james who was in the courtroom stared straight ahead at trump as he spoke and was seen chuckling when trump suggested she didn t know anything about one of his properties that s across the street from her office afterward she told reporters he rambled he hurled insults but we expected that monday s testimony centered on the core of the allegations by the state attorney general that trump and his company intentionally inflated property values and deceived banks and insurers in the pursuit of business deals and loans echoing the stance taken by two of his sons in their own testimony last week trump sought to downplay his direct involvement in preparing and assessing financial statements that the attorney general claims were grossly inflated and fraudulent all i did was authorize and tell people to give whatever is necessary for the accountants to do the statements he said as for the results i would look at them i would see them and maybe on some occasions i would have some suggestions he also played down the significance of the statements which went to banks and others to secure financing and deals pointing to a disclaimer that he said amounted to telling recipients to do their own calculating banks didn t find them very relevant and they had a disclaimer clause you would call it a worthless statement clause he said insisting that after decades in real estate i probably know banks as well as anybody i know what they look at they look at the deal they look at the location he complained that his 2014 financial statements shouldn t be a subject of the lawsuit at all first of all it s so long ago it s well beyond the statute of limitations trump said before turning on engoron saying he allowed state lawyers to pursue claims involving such years old documents because he always rules against me engoron said you can attack me in whichever way you want but

is the case said former gov jeb bush who was considered the frontrunner for the 2016 republican presidential primary before donald trump s ascent reshaped the party florida has long been influential in national politics never more so than in 2000 when there were five weeks of recounts and court challenges before george w bush carried the state and won the presidency by 537 votes and more and more floridians have sought the presidency as its population has exploded and chased out of power in tallahassee early in the 2016 presidential cycle many political observers thought former gov bush or sen marco rubio would win the republican nomination to challenge democrat hillary clinton trump at first wasn t taken seriously by either campaign until he blasted both of the floridians with insults as he rose to the top of the gop pile it wasn t the moment for either bush would have been the third member of his family to become president and trump s nickname of low energy jeb seemed to stick at a time when voters were in no mood for an establishment candidate with a whiff of inevitability maybe even entitlement rubio brought youthful energy to the campaign but he never found his footing against a brawling candidate who specialized in branding and dubbed him little marco rubio tried to match trump with branding of his own taunting trump about the size of his hands at one point but the shift in strategy only seemed to diminish him further and by then trump was well on his way to the gop nomination by 2020 trump had become a floridian himself changing his residence and voter registration to florida a state he desperately needed to win to earn a second term in the white house he did carry the state but lost to president joe biden in the rust belt thus adding his name to the list of floridians who lost a presidential bid that list keeps growing but includes askew bush rubio and former sen bob graham there is another notable asterisk president andrew jackson was the first territorial governor of florida in 1821 but it was a short stint to keep him busy as he tried to retire it s described as a troublesome few months before he returned home to tennessee and eventually ran for the white house from the volunteer state if you track jackson s progress towards being a presidential candidate florida has very very little to do with it said daniel feller a jackson historian and professor emeritus at the university of tennessee florida didn t do much damage to his national reputation but it certainly didn t help it any politics were decidedly different then anyway jackson basically took the job as a favor to president james monroe after the u s took over the territory from spain it was understood from the very beginning between jackson and monroe that this was going to be a temporary appointment said feller noting jackson s wife wasn t a fan of the idea jackson didn t think rachel would like it very much and he was right about that rachel hated it florida had a sparse population when it became a state in 1845 the federal census five years earlier counted fewer than 55 000 people nearly half of which were african american slaves it wasn t until air conditioning became more affordable and effective in the middle of the 20th century that the state s population started to grow that changed in a hurry though it more than doubled from fewer than 2 million in 1940 to more than 5 million in 1960 and hasn t stopped growing and its demographics shifted from a southern agricultural state to a hodgepodge population more reflective of the nation as a whole while north florida and the panhandle remain largely southern in their outlook the rest of the state is an eclectic mix immigrants from cuba haiti and other latin american countries have a large presence in south florida central florida has a large puerto rican population conservative midwesterners have moved to the southwest gulf coast in droves and liberal new englanders have migrated to the southeast atlantic coast there s plenty of intermingling between those groups but a large majority of the state s population was born outside of florida as the population has changed the state s politics have shifted what had been the key swing state in 2000 has been reliably republican in the past two presidential contests democrats dominated the state legislature for decades but republicans power has grown steadily this century democrats always had an advantage in voter registration until two years ago now republicans have about 5 2 million registered voters compared to about 4 6 million democrats the gop has easily held the legislature and governor s office since 1999 while republicans continue to be unstoppable in state politics the state has been less predictable in presidential years since the 2000 recount it supported bush for re election barack obama twice and trump twice trump is once again leading in florida polls while he won t participate in wednesday s debate in miami he is holding a rally nearby in a city that s 95 hispanic or latino a signal he s seeking to boost support with the state s hispanic voters the one sure bet is that floridians will keep trying to win the white house if neither desantis nor trump win in 2024 there s always 2028 and the possibility rubio and desantis run again perhaps joined by former governor and current sen rick scott who has long been speculated to have presidential ambitions former republican strategist rick wilson of florida who worked on the presidential campaigns of both george h w bush and george w bush said the state has been a political late bloomer on the national scene florida is a state that didn t really reach its political maturity as early as others said wilson a founder of the lincoln project which opposes both trump and desantis we had a much longer puberty where we were a backwater that all could change soon enough the money s here the importance of the vote is here the importance of the electoral college is here he said now we need somebody who actually has the skills

wednesday as court ended friday a state lawyer teased the former president s appearance asked who would be testifying monday andrew amer told the judge the only witness will be donald j trump trump has testified in court in at least eight trials since 1986 according to an associated press review of court records and news coverage he also has been questioned under oath in more than a dozen depositions and regulatory hearings in 1985 he was called to testify before congress as owner of the usfl s new jersey generals and he testified on behalf of lawyer and friend roy cohn at a state disciplinary hearing that led to cohn s disbarment in an early flash of his firebrand persona in 1986 trump told new jersey s casino commission that plans for highway overpasses near one of his casinos would be a disaster it would be a catastrophe those testimonies captured in thousands of pages of transcripts and some on videotape offer clues to the approach trump is likely to take when he testifies in manhattan they show clear parallels between trump as a witness and trump as a president and current candidate for the office his rhetorical style in legal proceedings over the years bears echoes of his political verve a mix of ego charm defensiveness aggressiveness sharp language and deflection he has been combative and boastful but sometimes vague and prone to hedging or being dismissive testifying in the usfl s antitrust lawsuit against the nfl in 1986 trump denounced allegations that he had spied on nfl officials at one of his hotels calling the claim such a false interpretation it s disgusting in 1988 as he sought to buy eastern air lines northeast shuttle service trump turned on the charisma flashing a wide smile at the judge s female law clerks and shaking hands with the bailiff during a break in his testimony at a federal court hearing in washington trump testified that his 365 million purchase later approved would be a major boost in morale for employees on the stand in a boxing related case in 1990 trump described a mike tyson fight he planned for one of his casinos in atlantic city new jersey as one of the greatest rematches you could have accused by two men of cutting them out of a riverboat gambling project trump professed ignorance testifying in 1999 i was shocked by this whole case i had no idea who these people were trump was briefly called to the witness stand in the new york case last month to explain comments outside of court that the judge said violated a limited gag order before that he last testified in a courtroom in 2013 two years before launching his winning presidential campaign an 87 year old suburban chicago widower had sued him over changes to contract terms for a hotel and condominium tower she had bought units in as an investment trump grew increasingly agitated as his testimony wore on at one point raising his arms and bellowing and then she sued me it s unbelievable chicago lawyer shelly kulwin cross examined trump on behalf of the plaintiff jacqueline goldberg he said the tenor of trump s testimony inside the federal courthouse in chicago echoed the bruising ebb and flow later seen at campaign rallies and on tv his demeanor was calm at first and then argumentative defensive off topic speechmaking exactly what he does today kulwin said in an interview based on my experience with him you better be able to have super tight questions with documents to support them so that he cannot wiggle around kulwin added i would approach the judge and have him admonished before he even got on the stand mr trump this is not a political campaign these people you re not trying to get their vote this is a judicial proceeding goldberg lost to trump but said she did not regret suing him testifying somebody had to stand up to him she died in august at age 97 trump has attended seven days of the new york trial quietly studying witnesses from the defense table while also lashing out at the case the judge and state lawyers in front of tv cameras in the hallway he s called the case a sham a scam and a continuation of the single greatest witch hunt of all time opining about the case on social media he thrills in what he calls the trial s perry mason moments testimony and arguments he feels have helped his side as he pays homage to the classic tv courtroom drama in 1990 trump testified in a losing effort in a lawsuit over his company s failure to make pension contributions on behalf of about 200 undocumented polish workers hired to tear down a building to make way for trump tower a year later he was in court again in manhattan testifying against a man who claimed he had a contract to develop trump s board game and was owed 25 of profits from trump the game trump won that one and another lawsuit in 2005 where he testified that a construction company had fleeced him by overcharging him by 1 5 million for work at a golf course in new york s westchester county trump s current new york trial hinges in part on how much he and other trump organization executives were involved in valuing his properties and calculating his wealth for the annual financial statements that were given to banks insurers and others to make deals and secure financing james alleges the statements inflated trump s net worth by billions of dollars making him appear to lenders as a more worthy credit risk and allowing him to obtain better interest and insurance rates trump has denied wrongdoing eric and donald trump jr testified that they relied on an outside accounting firm and the trump organization s finance team to prepare the statements and that they assumed those statements were accurate trump testified in a deposition in a case in april that he never felt his financial statements would be taken very seriously and that a disclaimer on them warned people doing business with him to do their own homework he insisted the banks that james alleges were snookered with lofty valuations suffered no harm got paid in his deals and to this day have no complaints trump decried the lawsuit as a terrible thing telling james and her staff you don t have a case before the trial the judge ruled that the statements were fraudulent he set in motion punishment that shifts control of some trump companies to a court appointed receiver an appeals court has put that on hold for now the nonjury trial now into its second month concerns allegations of conspiracy insurance fraud and falsifying business records james who is suing trump his company and top executives including his eldest sons is seeking 250 million in penalties and a ban on the defendants doing business in new york when questioned in the past about his business and financial dealings trump has sometimes deflected responsibility and blame in a 2013 deposition over a failed florida condominium project trump blamed an employee for paperwork that said he was developing a project when in reality he wasn t i have a woman that does it he said he then started parsing the wording at issue saying but you know developing the word develop it can be used in a lot of different contexts another refrain in trump s depositions is his incredulity that he would be taken so seriously for hyping up his real estate projects you always want to put the best possible spin on a property that you can trump said in a december 2007 deposition in his lawsuit against a journalist he had accused of playing down trump s wealth no different than any other real estate developer no different than any other businessman no different than any politician trump s penchant for puffery is sure to come up on monday he and his company are accused of inflating his property values and using a variety of methods to maximize the results for years he even listed his trump tower penthouse in manhattan as being three times its actual size he now claims his financial statements undersold his wealth and that his mar a lago resort in florida is worth more than 1 billion trump is portraying the civil fraud case and his four criminal cases as prongs of political persecution designed to impede his candidacy as the 2024 republican front runner for president he has referenced his political standing in prior legal settings including during a 2016 deposition when he noted unprompted how he had defeated his republican primary opponents i obviously have credibility because i now as it turns out became the republican nominee running against we have a total of 17 people that were mostly senators and governors highly respected people so it s not like you know like i ve said anything that could be so bad he said in his april deposition trump soberly described the presidency as the most important job in the world

of the dangers posed by tomatoes and other fruit which he feared would be thrown at him on the campaign stage you get hit with fruit it s no it s very violent stuff he said trump was testifying in connection to a lawsuit filed by a group of protesters who said they were roughed up by trump s private security guards when he was running in 2015 trump had been asked about a rally in which he told the crowd if you see someone getting ready to throw a tomato just knock the crap out of them would you it was said sort of in jest buy maybe you know a little truth to it trump said of his remarks it s very dangerous stuff you can get killed with those things he warned i wanted to have people be ready because we were put on alert that they were going to do fruit and some fruit is a lot worse than

to conservatives on gun policy reform.,Sara Boboltz,2023-11-05 00:00:00,once again on friday president joe biden toured the site of a mass shooting this time in lewiston maine and renewed calls for gun reform the week before an incident that claimed 18 had almost proved devastating enough to bridge the bipartisan divide between state lawmakers on gun control almost during a press conference in the immediate aftermath of the attack rep jared golden a centrist democrat representing maine called for a total ban on assault weapons an about face from a congressman who d previously opposed such legislation i have opposed efforts to ban deadly weapons of war like the assault rifle used to carry out this crime he said the time has now come for me to take responsibility for this failure which is why i now call on congress to ban assault rifles flanking him was sen susan collins a centrist republican who in contrast shied away from any significant calls to action on guns she instead pointed to maine s active yellow flag law as the answer she claimed the measure which allows police to remove a person s guns if a medical professional deems them at risk of serious physical harm and a judge signs off on it should have been enough to stop the shooting before it happened the fact that the suspect was hospitalized for two weeks for mental illness should have triggered the yellow flag law she said he should have been separated from his weapons her statement highlighted the shallow nature of the one of a kind law which requires an improbable set of circumstances and harmony between three separate entities to take effect over the following week reporters learned that the shooter robert card had indeed been previously hospitalized over mental illness after hearing voices and threatening to shoot up a local army national guard base local law enforcement had been documenting concerns about him for months and a friend in his army reserves unit worried he was going to snap and commit a mass shooting card seemingly ticked every box for setting maine s yellow flag law in motion and yet he was still able to carry out the state s deadliest shooting on record there are a lot of changes u s policymakers could make that have been credited with stopping mass shootings in other countries banning assault style weapons buying back existing weapons enacting universal background checks mandating waiting periods after gun purchases and implementing magazine size limitations for example but so far red flag laws policies that provide a method for regular people to separate an individual from their weapons have been one of the only substantive policies to garner bipartisan support in the states and they ve seen some success florida for example enacted one after the devastating 2018 parkland school shooting judges there have invoked it thousands of times according to cnn but it is an uphill battle maine tried to enact a red flag law and created a new flimsier category which republicans like collins hold aloft as evidence of action in the first six months of 2019 one gunman took 13 lives at a virginia beach municipal building and another ended six lives at an illinois manufacturing plant one man shot and killed five people at a florida bank and three days later another person murdered another five at two louisiana churches that summer maine state legislators debated guns or whether the state government should be able to take them away mainers generally carried a more permissive view of gun control given the state s tradition of hunting and residents perception of safety so while state legislators considered a red flag law they rejected it instead a compromise with moderates and conservatives produced a law that was similar in theory but harder to implement in practice red flag laws generally work by giving a judge the power to issue a protection order against an individual called an emergency risk protection order allowing police to seize their firearms often the person s friends or relatives will ask the court to do this out of concern for the individual s mental health but law enforcement can also initiate the process the judge must then agree that the individual is at risk of hurting themselves or others many states in the northeast new york massachusetts connecticut and rhode island among them have these laws on the books to critics though the proposal raised concerns over due process or constitutional protections against wanton action by the government the constitution explicitly states that the government can t infringe on an individual s life liberty or property without due process of law essentially critics including the national rifle association have argued that red flag laws made it too easy to take away someone s guns and too easy for someone to do it in bad faith the sportsman s alliance of maine an outdoor advocacy group helped maine lawmakers pass a bill meant to address those concerns maine public radio reported the sportsman s alliance did not return multiple requests for comment from huffpost for a maine judge to issue a protective order separating an individual from their firearms police have to do a lot more work a friend or relative can tell police that they are concerned about someone but it s up to law enforcement to agree to place the individual in protective custody and have them evaluated by a medical expert who needs to agree that the individual is at risk of harming themselves or others it created obstacles that did not exist in the states that have red flag laws said margaret groban a former federal prosecutor who now teaches firearms law at the university of maine school of law asked about the due process concerns groban told huffpost i don t accept those as valid red flag laws already provide the opportunity to argue one s case before a judge and judges are used to evaluating claims made in other contentious settings she said these are done under penalty of perjury she said of the red flag requests the same argument is made in the protection order context that people will make false accusations and they will manipulate that for either a divorce proceeding or a custody proceeding or something like that it s up to a judge to determine whether or not there s sufficient evidence she said adding they should be able to see through that after the lewiston shooting democrats in maine which has a democratic trifecta have indicated they will look at gun control again next legislative session states are being actively encouraged to pass red flag laws the gun safety package passed by congress in 2022 around a month after the mass shooting at an elementary school in uvalde texas contained incentives for such legislation if the recent past is any indication though that will be a tall order former arizona gov doug ducey r once voiced support for such laws but in 2020 he declared as long as i am governor there will be no red flag law in the state of arizona ohio gov mike dewine r backed off support for a red flag law in 2019 just a couple of months after a shooter killed nine people in dayton tennessee gov bill lee r has faced stiff opposition from gop colleagues to a red flag law this year after a shooter took six lives at nashville s covenant school on the national stage the fight for gun control has also been stymied by republicans universal background checks would close a gaping loophole that allows people who fail a background check from a licensed dealer to simply buy one from a private seller the biden administration has attempted to tackle the problem in a roundabout way amid republican stonewalling a federal bump stock ban enacted by the trump administration is currently being challenged in the courts the supreme court agreed this week to take up the case and the kind of national ban on assault style weapons biden has called on lawmakers to pass seems dead in the water polling repeatedly shows from republican and democratic voters for tighter gun control policies if one there was the political willpower to actually do it

secretary of state took his diplomatic push on the to the occupied west bank on sunday trying to assure palestinian president that the biden administration was intensifying efforts to ease the plight of gaza s civilians and insisting that palestinians must have a main say in whatever comes next for the territory after the conflict blinken later flew to baghdad for talks with iraqi prime mohammed shia al sudani as american forces in the region face a surge of attacks by iranian allied militias in iraq and elsewhere u s forces shot down another one way attack drone sunday that was targeting american and coalition troops near their base in neighboring syria a u s official said president s top diplomat traveled through the west bank city of ramallah in an armored motorcade and under tight security it was his third day of shuttle diplomacy aimed at trying to limit the destabilizing regional fallout from the war and overcome what has been israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu s refusal to consider a u s proposal for intermittent pauses in its attack on hamas long enough to rush vital aid to gaza s civilians netanyahu had friday against the u s pressure to start implementing pauses in the fighting saying there would be no temporary cease fire until hamas releases some 240 foreign hostages it is holding this is a process blinken told reporters on the matter sunday israel has raised important questions about how humanitarian pauses would work we ve got to answer those questions including how pauses would affect hamas hostages we re working on exactly that the biden administration while remaining the strongest backer of israel s military response to hamas attacks on oct 7 is increasingly seeking to use its influence with israel to try to temper the effect of israel s weeks of complete siege and near round the clock air ground and sea assaults in gaza home to 2 3 million civilians blinken s meeting with abbas in the west bank came on the same day that bombed two refugee camps in gaza killing at least 53 people according to health officials in gaza an associated press reporter saw the dead bodies of eight children brought in to a nearby gaza hospital after one of those strikes israel s military announced its forces had effectively split the gaza strip in two before an expected escalated assault on hamas targets in the north as word spread of blinken s arrival in ramallah palestinians turned out to protest u s support for israel s war demonstrators held signs showing dripping blood and with messages that included blinken blood is on your hands neither blinken nor abbas spoke as they greeted each other in front of cameras and their meeting ended without any public comment the palestinian authority administers semiautonomous areas of the israeli occupied west bank it has not been a factor in the gaza strip since 2007 when hamas seized control after winning in elections there a year earlier abbas himself is unpopular among palestinians blinken said in baghdad that the palestinian authority is playing a very important role right now in the west bank in trying to keep stability there that s hugely important because no one wants another front in the west bank or anywhere else and they re really stepping up under very difficult conditions to do the necessary work he said that what we all agree is that in shaping a future for gaza the west bank and ultimately for a palestinian state palestinian voices have to be at the center of that the palestinian authority is the representative of those voices so it s important that it play a leading role abbas however said the palestinian authority would only assume power in gaza as part of a comprehensive political solution to the israeli palestinian conflict according to the palestinians official wafa news agency he also condemned israel s bombardment of gaza as a genocidal war and urged blinken to immediately stop them from committing such crimes the new agency reported on his second trip to the middle east since the war began blinken met with israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu on friday before saturday netanyahu so far has rejected humanitarian pauses the arab officials pushed for an immediate cease fire blinken said that would be counterproductive and could encourage more violence by hamas u s officials believe that netanyahu may soften his opposition to the pause idea if he can be convinced that it is in israel s strategic interests to ease the plight of palestinian civilians in gaza the soaring death toll among palestinians more than 9 700 according to officials of gaza s hamas run health ministry has sparked growing international anger over the weekend to demand a cease fire now arab states are resisting american suggestions that they play a larger role in resolving crisis expressing outrage at the civilian toll of the israeli military operations but believing gaza to be a problem largely of israel s own making among arab leaders blinken said it is clear that everyone would welcome the humanitarian pause he said it could advance things that we re all trying to accomplish including freeing hostages bringing in aid and getting out foreign citizens on that last point he said we ve had important progress there in recent days but also real complications that come along with it we continue to work through them in baghdad the talks touched on the security of u s forces i made very clear that the attacks the threats coming from the militia that are aligned with iran are totally unacceptable and we will take every necessary step to protect american personnel blinken said before heading to turkey he said the prime minister expressed his own determination to stop the militia strikes the u s has deep concerns that iran and its proxies including several militia groups in iraq may take advantage of the situation in gaza to further destabilize the middle east already iranian backed militias have intensified rocket and other attacks on u s military facilities in iraq and syria drawing at least one retaliatory strike from american forces sunday s attack by drone against a u s site in syria was at least the 32nd on u s and coalition military facilities in iraq and syria since oct 17 to date there have been at least 17 attacks in iraq and 15 in syria at least 21 service members have been injured by the attacks but all have returned to duty the pentagon said the same u s official who confirmed the u s shootdown of the drone said the drone strike was very similar to other recent attacks on u s personnel at bases in iraq and syria and is believed at this point to be linked to iranian backed militia the official was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity

the front yard by this point the three israelis have made it to the shelter but not to safety the fighter tosses a grenade and the explosion throws the father s crumpled body against the shelter entrance the boys emerge they are coated in blood it s not clear how much of it is their father s one boy appears to be missing an eye daddy s dead shay itay one of the boys tells his brother later inside the house where a hamas fighter orders them to stay while he ransacks their refrigerator briefly offering them water before helping himself to some soda it s really not a prank as the reality sets in they weep the one who was blinded sits at a table clutching his face his brother throws himself to the floor why am i alive why am i alive eventually they are seen running out of the house the israeli defense forces confirmed that the boys survived they are the lucky ones on friday afternoon the idf screened raw footage of hamas oct 7 attack on israeli civilians in which some 1 400 people were killed for an audience of three journalists at a jewish foundation office in manhattan the videos which are not being released publicly were drawn from body cameras worn by hamas fighters who were killed in the subsequent clashes with israeli security forces they also include footage from cctv cameras and from the israeli victims cellphones which the terrorists seized and used to livestream their killing and even call their own parents back in gaza the military first showed the gruesome 47 minute montage to foreign correspondents at a base in tel aviv on oct 23 and again to reporters in new york on oct 27 edited versions of some of the videos had already circulated online prompting rabbis across the world to urge congregants particularly children to temporarily quit social media to avoid the gore but idf lt col amnon shefler says the idf decided to screen the raw footage to select journalists and diplomats to combat attempts by antisemitic conspiracists and some critics of israel s fierce military campaign in gaza to deny or downplay hamas atrocities recent videos in cities such as new york boston and london show young people tearing down posters of the nearly 200 children and adults hamas took hostage in the attack when confronted some of them claim the posters designed to look like public notices about kidnapped children are promoting fake news and that removing them is an act of support for palestinians as the idf has arranged these screenings israel s military campaign in gaza has killed at least 9 061 palestinians including 3 760 children as of thursday according to data from the united nations the numbers which the u n said it could not independently verify come from the hamas run gaza health ministry and the israeli government but they appear to align with what experts would expect based on the extent of the bombing in a densely populated area where almost half the population is below the age of 18 back in 2002 when a raid in gaza killed 14 civilians the israeli military this time however the military water food and electricity in the territory and has refugee in acts that have spurred even some of israel s most ardent allies to the idf s latest screening of the footage took place friday afternoon in a nearly empty conference room at the offices of the uja federation of new york a jewish philanthropy on 59th street a few blocks from central park though i reported israel i have not been actively writing about the war but when a publicist working for the idf contacted me friday morning to ask if i would join the viewing i agreed in part to bear witness and to spare a colleague the gruesome task two uniformed idf officers greeted me in the empty hallway of the foundation s office and asked me and the other two journalists to turn our phones off and leave them in a basket outside the conference room where the videos would be played shefler one of the two officers present said this precaution was necessary to avoid the videos leaking and traumatizing the victims families the montage opens with an explanation that what follows is raw footage collected from a variety of sources and documenting the deaths of at least 138 people fewer than 10 of the israelis killed on oct 7 the idf said the montage represents a fraction of the material they have obtained and that analysts are still combing through all of it before any images appeared on the screen we heard a low droning sound i thought for a moment it was some kind of ominous soundtrack it was an engine the camera affixed to the dashboard of a civilian s silver hatchback shows a scene of what looks like a professional fighting force of soldiers stopping a car at a checkpoint a crack in the windshield indicates where the men shot the driver but the car keeps rolling forward the goriest scenes include shots of at least two babies their faces blurred but the pink brain matter oozing from the back of their heads visible we saw a woman in pajamas tangled in her bedsheets and hanging off her mattress skull fragments and dried blood in her hair a little girl no older than 8 in her underwear in bed her arms raised her head partly blown off another little girl about the same age facedown in bed shot in the back of the head it s difficult to say whether it was harder to watch the scene of hundreds of festivalgoers running for their lives across an open field like a frightened herd i felt both captivated by this unusual image and sick knowing what was coming next or the footage of what became of many of them a young man films himself and the bloodied bodies of his friends in the building where they are sheltering he points his phone outside to show the lifeless body of a young woman sprawled on the ground everyone still alive is covered in mud and blood and panting in fear the young man s face comes into view his eyes blaze with terror hamas fighters find the man and his friends and drag at least three of them into the back of a pickup truck one of the israelis is holding aloft what remains of his mangled arm perhaps hoping gravity will keep him from bleeding out later footage shows the body of another concertgoer a tall person with locs who was not identified but matches the description of the german israeli stripped to their underwear facedown in the bed of a pickup two fighters are sitting on the body one of them smiles his expression like those i ve seen in photographs of hunters with a slain buck they appear to have entered gaza and people run up to the truck to see the body and spit on it in another scene from what appears to be early evening a fighter comes upon a bullet riddled car and the dead young woman who tried to escape in it she s wearing a skirt and boots one of which gets briefly caught under the dashboard as he pulls her out by the armpits and throws her slender frame to the ground woo he exclaims more than once in the same tone someone might use on a roller coaster later footage from rescue workers body cameras shows pits of charred bodies that resemble the debris left behind by wildfires the blackened limbs stiff in the air like the remnants of incinerated trees the remains are so burnt it s impossible to tell how many individual bodies this ghastly amalgam comprises not everyone was completely immolated another scene shows a young woman lying dead next to a car her bare legs visible beneath her hiked up skirt are smudged with dirt and blood her face is mutilated her head half burned her eyelids and lips gone clips of intercepted audio aired on black screens with subtitles offer little reprieve from the grisly violence on the phone with his commander a fighter says he is cutting off the heads of victims with a knife his commander reminds him to photograph the decapitated heads that audio is followed by bodycam footage from a fighter looking down at a middle aged thai man one of the tens of thousands who come from the southeast asian nation to work on farms in israel he is lying on the concrete outside a building his yellow t shirt stained with blood from bullet wounds to his stomach it s not clear at this moment whether he s still alive the fighters decide to behead him one swings a hoe striking the man s neck with a loud thump he cheers that god is great and another fighter seizes the garden tool and takes a swing himself the blade apparently blunt does not immediately sever the man s head they repeat the process a particularly disturbing moment which has been highlighted in previous reports on the footage comes only from audio an excited fighter calls his father in gaza pleading with them to check whatsapp and see the photos he sent he tells them he is calling from the phone of a dead jewish woman your son killed jews the man tells his father i killed 10 with my bare hands the father says little and you can hear the fighter s mother in the background he repeats himself over and over again mom i killed 10 jews with my own hands he says the man s mother shrieks and begins to sob she can only muster one sentence may god bring you back safely he seems frustrated that she isn t joining in his jubilation mom your son is a hero he insists kill kill kill when the video ended our conference room was silent except for the sounds of deep breaths and pens scribbling shefler opened the blinds to reveal the afternoon sun pouring down lexington avenue he plucked a seat from the front row and sat down turning to face us no one said anything for a few minutes i wrote in my notebook that i envied the audiences who saw this footage with dozens of other people that the intimacy of this event particularly haunted me the images of dead children felt disturbingly familiar after weeks of watching the horrors of gazan civilians recovering from the rubble of bombed apartment buildings the screams reminded me of the newsreels i d watched from hospitals in gaza where bombing survivors underwent as supplies dwindled the suddenness of death recalled the i d seen of civilians attempting to evacuate to southern gaza as the israeli military ordered as they fled called to mind the videos shot and released by the islamic state terrorist group at the height of its power nearly a decade ago that insurgency which seized broad swaths of territory in iraq and syria soared to global infamy in 2014 after publishing a video of one of its prominent british recruits beheading american journalist james foley with a combat knife the snuff film was carefully staged foley was forced to wear an orange jumpsuit like the uniforms in which the u s dresses inmates at guantanamo bay subsequent videos from the group followed even crueler designs a captured jordanian fighter pilot was burned alive a group of iraqi prisoners drowned in a cage that isis fighters slowly lowered into water and yet even those videos were stylized planned out slickly presented by contrast the montage of footage from so many different cameras and angles and moments on oct 7 including scenes of fighters hunting and shooting victims as they tried to hide felt realer almost like being there realizing this while sitting in the safety of a guarded building in new york brought on a nauseating feeling of guilt eventually i looked up and locked eyes with shefler who cleared his throat i m really sorry you had to watch that he said i m more sorry that this happened that it is happening i hope it s another way to understand why we are doing what we believe needs to be done to make sure this never happens again which means the full dismantling of hamas i asked if the women whose skirts were hiked up were raped he said the idf could not confirm its legal evidence of sexual assault yet and that many of the bodies are so mutilated by fire and bullets that it has been difficult to identify everyone but he said a number of female bodies had shattered pelvises and that many of the women found in their beds were stripped of their clothes before they were shot in the head or chest they likely didn t go to bed naked he said

Date,2023-11-04 00:00:00,las vegas in their zeal to make third on the calendar nevada easier for to win in the 2024 republican presidential primary state gop officials may instead have created a scenario that could delegitimize the result entirely by giving zero delegates to a candidate who wins the most ballots it s a nightmare it s a debacle i don t even know where to start said former state party chair amy tarkanian instead of holding either a caucus or a primary nevada is holding both just two days apart in early february the primary on feb 6 is being conducted by the state using all the state voting precincts with ballots mailed to every registered republican the caucus on feb 8 requires participants to find the site closest to their home designated by the pro trump state party during two specific hours that night to cast a paper ballot that will be counted by hand by the pro trump state party this is a way for them to make sure not only that donald trump wins but to ensure that he wins the majority of the delegates tarkanian said and because primaries by their very design almost always have higher participation rates than caucuses the winner of the primary could easily collect far more ballots than the winner of the caucus even though the participants of the primary will not win any of the delegates nevada will send to the summer nominating convention i think it will disenfranchise a number of voters that are interested in voting for a presidential candidate nevada republican gov joe lombardo this week about the dueling elections i think that s unacceptable for the voters and the understanding of how things should be done he also suggested the motivations of the party leaders were obvious i think we all can surmise the reason why it was brought forward but i think it s detrimental he said i think it just continues in the disarray or the chaos that s occurring within the currently it s unfortunate i ve had numerous conversations both with the state party and other individuals involved and it s falling on deaf ears trump s rivals were more direct in their criticisms of the state party s machinations which included forbidding candidates supportive super pacs such as never back down effectively the primary campaign vehicle for florida gov ron desantis from advertising or organizing for the caucus it is disappointing that the nevada republican party changed the rules against the will of the people just to benefit one candidate andrew romeo communications director for desantis campaign said last month when desantis decided to run in the caucus anyway some support rigged elections if they get to do the rigging said marc short an adviser to former vice president who filed to run in the primary but subsequently dropped out of the race michael mcdonald the chair of the nevada republican party disputed accusations that he is backing trump telling huffpost he appeared just this week with two other candidates running for the 2024 republican nomination former new jersey gov chris christie and north dakota gov doug burgum i often do this for any republican candidate as state chairman yet mcdonald whose public justifications of the need for a caucus lean on the same set of lies trump began spreading about mail ballots and early voting well ahead of the 2020 election also explicitly endorsed trump at his las vegas rally on oct 28 you give us a fair election i ll give you the next president of the united states donald j trump that the state party is backing the coup attempting former president is perhaps not surprising given its leadership mcdonald and republican national committee member jim degraffenreid have both supported trump for years while the other rnc member sigal chattah called trump both the 45th and 47th president at his rally last weekend mcdonald and degraffenreid were also both fraudulent electors for trump in 2020 each signed a document falsely claiming they were valid electors for trump in the electoral college when in fact trump lost the state by 34 000 votes nevada was among five states where trump supporters with the coordination and support of both the trump campaign and the rnc to congress so that pence in his role as president of the senate could use the existence of competing elector slates to to award trump a second term despite his election loss he refused to go along with the scheme and trump eventually told the rioting mob that he had summoned to washington that day for the purpose of pressuring pence to go home both mcdonald and degraffenreid were called before the house jan 6 committee where both invoked their fifth amendment rights not to incriminate themselves when asked questions about that day both under a limited immunity agreement before the federal grand jury that ultimately indicted trump for actions related to his coup attempt meaning both are potential if not likely witnesses at trump s trial on those charges next spring mcdonald who had his phone seized by the fbi as part of the trump investigation did not respond to huffpost queries about his grand jury testimony degraffenreid said his lawyer had advised him not to discuss it and he declined to do so former state chair tarkanian said the current state party leadership s devotion to trump and involvement with him in his accused criminal behavior should give nevada s republican voters pause the state party is basically being run by people who are willing to throw themselves on the railroad tracks for this man she said these are the people who are going to run a process with honesty and integrity give me a break separate from the question of fairness and impartiality is the matter of confusion the 636 097 republican voters in the state will all receive a primary ballot in the mail which they can fill out and return or if they choose can go to one of the state run polling places to vote on primary election day feb 6 two days later the state party will stage their caucus most likely at far fewer sites around the state for a two hour period that evening where voters can also cast a ballot south carolina sen tim scott and former south carolina gov nikki haley are participating in the primary while christie burgum businessman vivek ramaswamy and desantis are in the caucus along with trump you re going to have a lot of very confused and disappointed voters who go to the polls and find their pony isn t there to be picked tarkanian predicted david gibbs president of the nevada republican club wrote to state party leaders before their sept 23 meeting telling them that given a new law requiring a state run primary when there is a competitive election it would be unnecessarily expensive and more important confusing for the party to stage its own caucus the nevada republican party will give average voters the impression they don t care about them or their votes how do you think that will make them feel disenfranchised angry and potentially less willing to support the republican party further he wrote in a letter signed on behalf of the 400 member group s leaders during the 2016 caucuses just 75 200 of the state s 505 818 registered republicans cast ballots in the in person only event 14 9 in the 2022 primary for the gop nomination for governor 228 544 of the state s 627 530 registered republicans cast ballots in the state run election 36 4 more than double the caucus turnout rate if that pattern continues this year the winner of the feb 6 primary could easily draw more votes than the winner of the feb 8 caucuses but wind up with none of the state s 26 delegates to the summer nominating convention those will all be awarded based on the caucus result and the party is not allowing candidates who participate in the primary to enter the caucus even if the winner of the february 6th primary received more votes than the winner of the february 8th caucus it won t matter they won t get delegates gibbs wrote the voters will not react well to that nor will the campaigns at the rally last weekend where mcdonald effectively endorsed trump he also mocked the candidates who chose to enter the primary president trump and several other people are not going to be on that ballot because that s for the democrats they re going to be competing if you re a republican you re competing for a plastic tiara and we re going to give you a participation trophy he said and suggested to the trump supporters packed into stoney s rockin country nightclub that the primary would actually be rigged you go to bed your man or woman is winning you wake up the next day and they re behind by 3 000 votes mcdonald said you don t think they re trying to rig this degraffenreid who is also vice chair of the state party said he and other officials are aware of the potential for confusion we re obviously going to have a major voter education campaign he told huffpost based on the confusion evident in the line of trump followers waiting to enter stoney s last weekend the state party has its work cut out for it a dozen or so campaign staffers in team trump t shirts moved up and down the queue pigeonholing attendees gathering names and phone numbers and explaining about the two separate events 48 hours apart and that they should ignore the first one he s not going to be on the ballot a staffer told a woman in line as she filled out a commit to caucus card i didn t know that the woman replied roberto rivera a 48 year old retired new york city police officer said that if trump wants to be in the caucus and not the primary he supports that decision even if he doesn t really understand it it s a complicated thing you ve got to get online and find out where to go rivera said about the caucus process they re not making it easy renee bardot a 55 year old native of germany who said she came to the united states in 1991 because of freedom said she didn t know about the two different days and primary versus caucus she was enraged when she learned that the state run primary would not have trump s name on it if trump isn t on the ballot i m never going to vote again she said i have land in utah i ll go live there and raise sheep another woman wearing a denim jacket and trump 2024 button who spoke on condition of anonymity appeared perplexed and said she also did understand the need for two separate events and why trump did not simply appear on the primary ballot when told that trump critics and rivals were accusing him of forcing a caucus because it was easier to rig to ensure a trump victory she brightened oh she said with a smile that s good i want him to win

and wednesday it s not one or two airstrikes we are talking about eight nine 10 i can t even count all in the same place it s a catastrophe the strikes killed dozens of people and reduced parts of the

attack that killed more than 1 400 people in southern israel it also said the strikes hit a network of hamas tunnels beneath the neighborhood causing the buildings above to collapse critics say the vast destruction is evidence that israel s attacks are disproportionate and don t take precautions to avoid civilians israel says it does not target civilians and blames hamas for conducting military

driven from their homes during the war surrounding israel s creation in 1948 at the time some 700 000 palestinians were uprooted over the generations jabaliya has grown into an overcrowded

murdered in brutal fashion was a radicalizing event for many jews who carry with them ancestral memories of the holocaust and other incidents of antisemitic persecution jonathan levy who moved with his family to larchmont new york from brooklyn a couple years ago describes himself as a lifelong democrat who has never voted for a republican in his life he had been aware that bowman was more critical of israel than he liked and left the house part of the ballot blank in november 2022 after oct 7 levy began to feel that bowman and the activist left with which he is aligned were not adequately supportive of israel it was a terrorist attack on one of our allies the only democracy in the middle east levy said for a member who represents a seat that is 10 15 jews and probably a higher percentage of the voting population his response has been lame he called bowman s office to register his outrage at bowman s decision not to sign on to a resolution condemning hamas and supporting israel bowman like some other progressives not for its condemnation of hamas terror attack but for failing to also mention the suffering of palestinian civilians the two state solution or the urgent need for de escalation and prevention of ground invasion nor any humanitarian efforts bowman has from the democratic socialists of america for joining a trip to israel with the progressive pro israel group j street he has also voted to fund the defensive iron dome technology for israel but some pro israel voters are seeking someone with a more black and white view of the current situation levy who sees israel s military response as a warranted reaction to an unprovoked attack is all in on latimer or anyone else who runs against bowman the fire drill incident is extremely embarrassing he added and i think his excuse is bullshit bowman on sept 30 before leaving to cast his ballot on a spending bill to keep the government open he has to a misdemeanor charge of falsely pulling a fire alarm in d c court but insists that it was an accident made as he was trying to hastily leave the building latimer a former state lawmaker who boasts never losing an election in his career has said that there is also interest in his bid from business owners in the district and suggested that he would be a more under the radar lawmaker than bowman my style is not bombastic i m not going to be out there on the steps arguing with marjorie taylor greene latimer said my job as i view it is to be a good legislator work on legislation why the indecision then latimer said he will reveal his choice some time after the county legislative elections and a trip to israel sponsored by the westchester jewish council in late november latimer acknowledged though that he has heard from supporters of bowman s who warned him against mounting a divisive primary in a cycle when democrats are trying to take back the house there are apparently many such supporters in a commissioned by bowman s house office 82 of respondents said they approve of bowman s performance bowman has secured 26 million in federal funds for community projects in the past two fiscal years and another 50 million for the next fiscal year indeed latimer faces in a june 2024 primary against bowman for a host of reasons nearly half of new york s 16th congressional district is in the northern bronx where latimer has no name recognition since new york democrats are in the process of challenging the current congressional maps it s unclear where the district s final borders will be leaving the

lean operation hit hard by the grassroots fundraising drought affecting many political organizations laid off in july and august rojas told huffpost however that fundraising had picked up considerably

fire in the nearly month old war until hamas releases hostages the leader of the iran backed hezbollah militant group stoked fears that the conflict could widen by promising more attacks along the lebanon border israeli troops of gaza city the focus of their campaign to crush the enclave s who launched a brutal attack on israeli communities that started the war but ever since that there have been concerns the conflict could ignite fighting on other fronts and israel and the iranian backed militant group hezbollah have repeatedly traded fire along the lebanon border in his first public speech since the war began hezbollah leader said his group had entered the battle with the past weeks unprecedented cross border fighting we will not be limited to this he said suggesting escalation was possible still nasrallah stopped short of announcing that u s secretary of state antony blinken on his to israel since the war began reiterated u s support for israel in the war saying it has the right to defend itself but he said a humanitarian pause was needed to boost aid deliveries to palestinian civilians amid growing alarm over the humanitarian crisis in gaza after meeting blinken israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu said israel refuses a temporary cease fire that doesn t include a return of our hostages referring to some 240 people hamas abducted during its attack he said israel was pressing ahead with its military offensive with all of its power blinken said there had to be a substantial and immediate increase in humanitarian aid to gaza where we need to do more to protect palestinian civilians without that there are no partners for peace he said adding that it was critical to restore the path toward a two state solution to the israel palestinian conflict hezbollah an ally of hamas attacked israeli military positions in northern israel with drones mortar fire and suicide drones on thursday the israeli military said it retaliated with warplanes and helicopter gunships and spokesman rear adm daniel hagari said civilians were wounded in the hezbollah attacks we are in a high state of readiness in the north in a very high state of alert to respond to any event today and in coming days he said blinken said the u s which has deployed aircraft carriers and other forces in the eastern mediterranean was committed to ensuring that no second or third front opens in the conflict referring to hezbollah in his speech nasrallah said his militia is not deterred by u s warnings saying your fleets in the mediterranean will not scare us a war with hezbollah would be devastating for both israel and lebanon hezbollah is much stronger than hamas with an arsenal of some 150 000 rockets and missiles some believed to be precision guided weapons capable of striking deep inside israel israel has promised to unleash vast destruction in lebanon if all out war erupts accusing hezbollah of hiding its military installation in the midst of residential areas the two enemies fought an inconclusive monthlong war in 2006 renewed fighting could also risk drawing iran which backs both hamas and hezbollah into the conflict more than 9 200 palestinians have been killed in gaza so far mostly women and minors and more and than 23 000 people have been wounded said without providing a breakdown between civilians and fighters more than 1 400 people have died on the israeli side mainly civilians killed during hamas initial attack when some 240 people were also taken hostage some 5 400 have also been injured twenty four israeli soldiers have been killed in gaza since the start of the ground operation since the start of the war seven israeli soldiers and a civilian have been killed in different incidents along israel s border with lebanon as american officials have before blinken pledged unwavering support for israel and its right to defend itself we stand strongly for the proposition that israel has not only the right but the obligation to defend itself and to make sure that october 7 should never happen again said blinken who also plans to visit amman jordan it follows president joe biden s in the fighting the aim would be to let in aid for palestinians and let out more palestinians who hold foreign passports and wounded around 800 people left gaza over the past two days the first time people departed the besieged territory other than four hostages released by hamas and another blinken first held talks with netanyahu behind closed doors before starting wider discussions with the leader and his war cabinet and meeting with president isaac herzog have been killed in 25 days of fighting according to the health ministry in hamas run gaza bombardment has driven more than half the territory s 2 3 million people from their homes food water and fuel are running low under israel s siege and warn they are on the verge of collapse israel has allowed more than 260 trucks carrying food and medicine into gaza but aid workers say it s not nearly enough israeli authorities have refused to allow fuel in saying hamas is hoarding fuel for military use and would steal new supplies white house national security spokesman john kirby said the u s was not advocating for a general cease fire but a temporary localized pause israel has not openly responded to biden s suggestion but netanyahu who has previously said thursday we are advancing nothing will stop us he vowed to destroy hamas rule in the gaza strip israel and the u s seem to have if hamas rule in gaza is brought down a key question on blinken s agenda during the visit according to the state department meanwhile military officials said israeli forces have now completely encircled gaza city a densely packed cluster of neighborhoods that israel says is the center of hamas military infrastructure and includes a vast network of underground tunnels bunkers and command centers israeli forces are fighting in a built up dense complex area said the

established a task force on the gaza war that has dedicated slots for staff from many offices from diplomatic security and its middle east bureau to the teams handling legislative and business affairs to its europe bureau but according to an email viewed by huffpost it does not have such seats for the agency s bureau focused on rights issues the democracy human rights and labor bureau or its population refugees and migration bureau which handles the u s relationship with the u n agency responsible for much of gaza s economy population refugees and migration is state s chief humanitarian bureau and the rights office is responsible for tracking matters like violations of international law for those offices to be excluded from the team that among other responsibilities is tasked with drafting and circulating internal updates on israel palestine across the department means state could be missing the full story of how israel s bombardment and siege of gaza and accelerating destruction of the west bank are decimating civilian life and causing a humanitarian crisis of epic proportions a state department official said and to influential partners working with the u s government on the issue it s clear the state department has little influence compared to its role in other major dilemmas an official at an aid agency told huffpost over 3 weeks i think i ve had one substantive conversation with somebody at state and i ve asked for meetings normally they said the outbreak of a conflict would mean they were in regular back and forth and would have frequent substantive conversations with officials at state and the u s agency for international development which is under state s purview meanwhile i ve probably had six or seven conversations plus email exchanges plus two very high level meetings at the white house it s a very clear change of center of gravity said the official who requested anonymity to protect professional relationships a spokesperson for the national security council told huffpost the white house began holding meetings of a separate task force focused on the humanitarian situation in gaza the week before the atrocity prevention group met and so wanted to avoid duplicating work the spokesperson disputed that nsc staff had discouraged holding a meeting of the atrocity prevention task force and said the white house is not seeking to stifle any voices across national security agencies a spokesperson for the state department declined to comment on the task forces or concerns about blinken s outreach frustrated state department officials describe disillusionment and a sense of powerlessness as they watch the u s pursue policies they believe will cause immense suffering in the near term and painful blowback in the future it feels like we are advocates on the outside or civil society banging on the doors of government and that s not our role one department official said another blasted a moment of silence and reflection that state asked employees to observe on oct 30 to in the department s words mourn the innocent lives lost in current conflicts and stand united against terrorism and all forms of hate around the world and in the united states these hollow moves fail to acknowledge the complicity of our decisions and policy in the relentless suffering of gazans the official said the gesture ignores the fact that we still aren t pushing for a cease fire still not asking israel to control itself while biden blinken and others have said they expect israel to abide by the laws of war in its offensive american officials made any suggestion the u s would withhold assistance over worrying actions by the israelis on wednesday biden in fighting rather than a full cease fire last month that officials were drafting a formal dissent to blinken through state s storied dissent channel at least two dissents have now been submitted to his staff two state department officials said blinken welcomes opposing views and the use of the channel state department spokesman matthew miller said on oct 19 the secretary s team is to prepare responses to dissents one official said more dissent cables and memos are in the works from a diverse array of officials who want to express concern about the israel policy for particular reasons like their knowledge of regional affairs or their experience in combat zones they re framing this as emotionally affecting arabs and jews but it s affecting everybody with any conscience another state department official said noting as an example of disturbing ramifications a from fbi director christopher wray that the war could spark violence in the u s there s no discussion of what the u s interest is in all of this it doesn t seem like it s the priority the official continued career civil servants and lower ranking officials are used to decisions about the most sensitive global affairs matters being made way above their paygrades but even in fast paced situations they are accustomed to intensive deliberations in which subject matter experts help craft the recommendations and choices presented to leaders like the president and the secretary of state and are encouraged to use their skills to shape effective policy two officials drew a contrast between the current handling of israel palestine and how state department officials helped tackle a previous high profile dilemma facing biden the u s withdrawal from afghanistan in 2021 biden s decision to quickly pull out troops also upset some state staffers who felt it was unwise given the country s condition 23 officials in kabul signed a dissent cable at the time but they felt able to debate it and its implementation everyone was involved in the evacuation effort and there was room to hear from staff on how to improve processes even if the policy is set one official said but there isn t even room here to provide expertise on improving processes for example on getting humanitarian aid out there more expeditiously josh paul a veteran over the gaza policy in a development first reported by huffpost described a similar divergence i was deeply involved in a lot of the afghan evacuation and people certainly felt very passionately about that and remain of the sense that things were badly mishandled there paul said in a recent interview i didn t hear the same sort of desperation and lack of empowerment a current official called the lack of consultation fundamentally different from their recent experiences working on the invasion of ukraine and unrest in sudan some officials said state s town halls are leaving them even more exasperated as they learn about the apparent impotence of their managers they re saying discussions are happening at the highest levels aka there s no room for inputs said the first current official who has attended multiple listening sessions it s diplomatically clouded language they re not sharing what they re saying at those high level meetings either it s hush hush the second described particular concern about the town hall for the department s branch on human rights managers who described the branch as state s conscience indicated that they aren t sure if they are getting through to more senior officials this group of people is supposed to be pushing for a cease fire and humanitarian concerns and are doing so in every other context but when people asked senior folks they said we are pushing but we have no idea what is happening to any of that information the official said the narrative from powerful state department figures is sending a depressing signal said another official who attended the rights branch session as well as four other meetings we are getting the message that we shouldn t quit because we can make a difference from the inside while it s also clear that not only are working level staff excluded from these discussions even senior leaders at state are excluded from shaping the u s government response to the conflict the official said while blinken remains central to the biden administration s israel gaza policy he will again travel to the region this week there is a broad perception he is taking little advice from his own lieutenants and rank and file some u s officials and outside observers say that is making america s approach shortsighted and preventing washington from considering a different tack that could be less costly and more likely to encourage long term stability the aid official said one clear indication of state s limited role is that one of its highest profile actions since the war was deploying a new appointed special envoy for middle east humanitarian issues david satterfield the former ambassador has and is focused on getting aid and civilians through gaza s only exit point to another country egypt but his work is limited in its scope it seems like all of the humanitarian and diplomatic brainpower at state is being sucked up into operational discussions and not into policy discussions which i think tracks with the output we re seeing an administration that s deeply focused on the operations aspects of humanitarian access and not sufficiently focused on the policy challenges the official said the output is insufficient and myopic potentially myopic by design they continued pointing to the u s s focus on measures like how many trucks enter gaza or how many liters of water the territory has rather than whether washington should challenge israel s siege and ground invasion of the region a state department spokesperson told huffpost work being done by the department of state has been integral to the 217 trucks carrying critical humanitarian assistance that have been able to cross into gaza via the rafah border crossing we know that more is needed and the department continues to achieve work on increasing assistance through the rafah crossing in the coming days the spokesperson continued that is also why the administration announced earlier in october that the united states is providing 100 million in u s government support this funding through the state department s bureau of population refugees and migration and delivered by trusted partners will help to address immediate humanitarian needs of protection safe water sanitation hygiene emergency food shelter healthcare and additional humanitarian services for those affected by the conflict including women and children inside state officials worry the work they are doing related to israel palestine is being driven by the white house focus on messaging rather than producing the strongest impact for the u s last week biden sparked global outrage by publicly saying he does not trust the death toll reported by the hamas linked authorities in gaza that the state department regularly referenced that toll internally without caveats and documents viewed by huffpost since suggest the department is still doing so in keeping with most analysts and humanitarian organizations but on friday two days after biden s comments state s israel gaza task force privately asked colleagues at the department to seek out alternative sources it can cite in discussing gazan casualties a state department spokesperson told huffpost last week unfortunately given the limited ability of outside parties to verify figures provided by hamas it remains difficult to determine the total number of civilian casualties in gaza and no other alternatives exist at this time to the metrics provided by the hamas run ministry of health the department of state will continue to include data from a variety of sources for its internal reporting this is not indicative of how accurate we assess those data points to be officials also described frustration in being told to stick to national security council talking points on gaza rather than draw on their own vantage point while preparing for state s ongoing broader work like meetings with foreign counterparts the theory is you develop the best product the official said by incorporating analysis from a range of officials and offices are over the ongoing calamity in gaza and see the u s as covering for israel with rhetoric multiple officials said state officials are finding it hard to represent their government with wooden language amid that skepticism huffpost that senior biden administration officials discouraged the use of specific phrases including de escalation focusing on being on message can make it hard for officials across the administration to fully grapple with their choices at a critical moment over the past weeks as i have heard from numerous officials across both the executive and legislative branches it has become clear to me that many senior leaders not only fully understand how israel is currently using u s provided arms in gaza but are even behind closed doors willing to acknowledge that these actions include war crimes paul said the fact that none are willing to do so publicly not only points to a deep moral rot in our system but reflects a lack of frank debate that is ultimately most harmful to u s national security and foreign policy interests he continued the discord at state is stirring a reckoning that many compare to the period around the invasion of iraq amid the anxiety of feeling implicated in a policy with a brutal current impact and horrifying potential long term consequences officials say they are also afraid of repercussions if they advocate a change in approach attendees at some listening sessions responded to colleagues bringing up palestinian rights by trying to change the subject to the danger of antisemitism one official said it feels like the trump era again they said noting that some staff particularly muslims are censoring themselves and being subjected to attacks on social media and in right wing outlets messages from some managers also indicate some views could get diplomats into trouble per another official at a staff check in at a u s embassy in the persian gulf recently a leader said this is who we are strong allies with israel no apologies paul s resignation spurred talk of others following in his footsteps but officials noted quitting is often challenging financially and can cause reputational harm that makes it tough if not impossible to work in foreign policy again the alarm is especially acute among more junior personnel who like are more sympathetic to palestinians than older generations younger members of the department have been particularly afraid of speaking in meetings that they would normally feel comfortable in speaking in or of voicing their opinion to senior leaders or mentors who we assume we can share our perspective with in any other conflict or crisis situation an official said considering alternative careers is challenging they added there s a real fear that if you leave because these are not the politics of a lot of gen z that it will be obvious why you left in this time period that people will not vouch for you you ll be blacklisted they described many in their cohort as being inspired and now disillusioned with biden s contested some of those state personnel joined the administration because of the administration s push for new voices in the government particularly on really sensitive foreign policy issues the state department official continued we have generally found that to be the culture and it has shifted really really remarkably into a culture of silence in the past few weeks i think that s a disservice to policy

responsibility for failing to prevent hamas brutal attack on israeli communities during the oct 7 incursion that triggered the current conspicuously absent from that roll call is prime minister benjamin netanyahu following the which saw the deadliest day for israelis since the country was established 75 years ago netanyahu has repeatedly sidestepped accountability he has instead blamed others in what critics say shows a leader thinking more about his own political survival than soothing and steering netanyahu is fighting a personal battle of survival and that takes precedence over fighting israel s war against hamas said netanyahu biographer and journalist anshel pfeffer as part of that battle he s prepared to malign those who are now commanding israel s army and intelligence services when hundreds of hamas militants broke down israel s seemingly impenetrable security systems and stormed through its communities israel s vaunted security forces were some 1 400 people were killed and it took hours for soldiers to arrive the war has killed more than 9 000 palestinians according to palestinian health officials and ravaged many parts of the gaza strip the attack also among israeli military intelligence and political leaders that hamas was uninterested in a new conflict and that israel s military power served as a deterrent israel s top security brass including the military chief of staff the defense minister and the head of the domestic security agency shin bet came forward and accepted responsibility for the blunder in the days after the attack netanyahu however has not taken outright responsibility for the missteps that led up the horrific attack despite serving as prime minister for 13 of the past 14 years he says there will be time for investigations after the war this debacle will be investigated everyone will have to give answers including me netanyahu said two and half weeks after the attack but he has brushed off criticism and rejected suggestions that he should resign the only thing that i intend to have resign is hamas we re going to resign them to the dustbin of history he told reporters last weekend that s my responsibility netanyahu a polarizing figure in israel has also faced criticism over his response to the crisis he has been accused of failing to unite the nation with any resounding uplifting speech or act many israelis have who visited israel in the days after the attack as having better fulfilled that role netanyahu was criticized for waiting many days to visit with by hamas who mainly came from liberal leaning communal farms that tend not to vote for netanyahu the and israelis bemoan to address the urgent needs of 250 000 displaced israelis but the biggest uproar came over the weekend when in a late night tweet netanyahu pointedly blamed his security chiefs for the debacle saying he never received any warning from them about hamas intentions and that on the contrary he was guided by their advice that hamas was deterred netanyahu s new wartime governing partner slammed it during war leadership must act responsibly benny gantz a former military chief of staff posted on x formerly twitter calling on netanyahu to take back his words netanyahu deleted the tweet and later apologized saying it should not have been said but critics say the damage has been done idit shafran gittleman a senior researcher at israel s institute for national security studies said the tweet came at a time when faith in israel s security services is at a nadir there is harm to the security brass but also harm to the faith of soldiers on the ground who see their prime minister focused on things other than winning the war clashes between netanyahu and his security chiefs aren t new shafran gittleman pointed to his apparent refusal this year to accept their warnings that scores of senior reservists and fighter pilots key pillars of the military had threatened to stop serving if the overhaul continued though they have rushed back to duty since oct 7 netanyahu s allies and the core of his nationalist base say the israeli leader is facing unfair and poorly timed criticism by the same figures in the media and in the public who have long opposed him either we wait until a public inquiry that will determine who is to blame and for now we focus on victory over hamas or already now everyone blames everyone and netanyahu also has the right to respond shimon riklin a journalist close to netanyahu posted on x the attack and its aftermath have undeniably posed the biggest challenge to netanyahu s lengthy tenure and will likely forever stain his legacy it has shattered his carefully manicured image as a strong leader with burnished security credentials who has worked tirelessly to protect israel from its myriad threats opinion polls show support for netanyahu s likud party has tanked the public views him as significantly less fit to rule than his main political opponent gantz and his current coalition has nowhere near the support needed to govern were elections held today this is also not the first time netanyahu has shirked blame for a crisis on his watch he has dismissed a part of a media orchestrated witch hunt against him and last year into the deaths of 45 people at a stampede at a jewish pilgrimage site netanyahu said he was unaware of the issues that may have led to the trampling you can t take responsibility for what you don t know he said noam tibon a former military general who and rescued his son and his family from the hamas attack said the country needed unity to win the war but that netanyahu was sowing division every israeli needs to ask do i believe that netanyahu can lead israel to victory in this war

family s and company s civil fraud trial but the trump organization executive vice president insisted i had no involvement and never worked on my father s statement of financial condition though another trump organization executive has testified that eric trump was on a video call about his father s financial statement as recently as 2021 the son said he couldn t remember it i m on a thousand calls a day he said eric trump followed brother and fellow trump organization executive vice president to the stand on a closely watched and sometimes fractious day in the trial the day ended with judge arthur engoron suggesting he might expand a gag order after defense lawyers again criticized his law clerk s role in the case early in the trial engoron barred participants in the case from

than a decade has passed since the russian president engaged in public stunts by hugging a polar bear or riding a horse barechested in the mountains the war in ukraine has further putin is still expected to seek another term when russia holds presidential elections next march in fact he has pushed through to allow him to run for two more six year terms but 71 is an age when death or serious illness are hardly distant concerns for the man who has ruled russia for 24 years if putin was not on the ballot for some reason it s not clear who might take his place at the national level russia s political system is hermetic there are no primary elections where voters can choose a candidate political parties select their own contenders and then present them to the electorate in putin s absence the loyalist united russia party could put forth a candidate although there s no fixed procedure for it to choose one officially putin ran in 2018 as an independent a precedent adding uncertainty to how a replacement could emerge however it plays out a candidate almost certainly would come from within the current power structure as none of the lesser parties candidates would have wide recognition or support some potential contenders if putin isn t in the election as a putin surrogate becoming president in 2008 when putin could not seek reelection because of term limits despite the post he was widely regarded as secondary to putin who became prime minister and effectively still led the country he submissively acceded to putin s desire to run for a new term in 2012 serving as prime minister until 2020 he was then appointed to the new position of deputy head of the national security council although that post was low visibility and often seen as a sinecure medvedev s prominence soared last year when he abandoned his normally mild persona and became one of the most vehement defenders of the war in ukraine vividly denouncing the west that posture has appeal for russian nationalists but medvedev could be tarnished by the perception he was too accommodating to the united states as president during the obama administration s reset initiative as well as a high profile expose alleging corruption and garishly lavish living as governor of the tula region dyumin does not have wide public visibility but he has been tipped for years as possible putin successor due to his close relationship with the president including serving as his bodyguard dyumin did come to public notice with his dramatic claim that he had once saved putin from a bear in dyumin s telling he was at a mountain residence where putin was sleeping when he was informed a bear was outside the door the bear and i looked each other in the eyes he backed off a little i opened the door and discharged the entire clip of my pistol at his feet he said dyumin was the leader of special forces of the military intelligence agency in russia s 2014 annexation of crimea giving him an aura of valor and success related to ukraine in contrast to the grim struggles and failures of the current war if visuals matter in a russian presidential race sobyanin could have the strongest portfolio of anyone as mayor of moscow since 2010 the russian capital has undergone remarkable and visible changes new recreation areas pedestrian zones sports facilities and other amenities have flourished electric buses replaced rattling old trolleys new commuter rail lines reduced the city s notorious traffic jams and once ragged parks were tidied up and enhanced sobyanin offended western leaning liberals by banning lgbtq parades in the city but tolerance of gay rights is not a winning stance in russia sobyanin also has avoided the flamboyance and divisiveness of his predecessor yuri luzhkov russia s prime minister since 2020 mishustin has provoked no excitement and relatively little notice but he does have one significant potential advantage if putin were to die or become unable to fulfill his duties before the election mishustin would become acting president that s the same path putin took when he became acting president upon boris yeltsin s resignation on new year s eve 1999 then capitalized on the position to win election the following year mishustin doesn t appear to have that ambition however he is a quiet technocrat regarded as highly competent in his previous post as head of the national tax service as prime minister he has received approval ratings of up to 70 for supervising the administration and ministries although many observers think he was blindsided by putin s decision to invade ukraine he has continued his tasks stolidly the parallels between putin and patrushev are striking they were born in leningrad 10 months apart and patrushev became head of the federal security service the main kgb successor agency in 1999 when putin became prime minister now head of the national security council he echoes and sometimes amplifies putin s hawkish views and animosity toward the west although patrushev initially demurred on recognizing the independence of the rebel leadership in ukraine s separatist regions of donetsk and luhansk which preceded the invasion by a few days he later became a strong proponent of the war arguing that russia needed to wipe out what he called neo nazis on its doorstep and claiming that ukraine and its western orientation was a clear security

two steps away from victims of the horrific assault the deadliest day for jews since the holocaust and one that recalled the that moved generations of american jews ancestors to flee for the new world and as pro palestinian demonstrators assemble across the globe to protest israel s brutal counteroffensive which now includes a ground invasion antisemitic incidents as well but as many jews rally

gaza gazan health officials pushing the total above 3 600 children in more than a dozen interviews in the past week american jews speaking out against israel s military actions in gaza conveyed either a sense of frantic urgency or distraught helplessness miriam grossman a brooklyn based rabbi is one of dozens of calling for an end to the violence and the release of israeli hostages in gaza she told huffpost that the grief people feel over the recent bloodshed is sacred and so are their efforts to preserve life as a rabbi it feels very painful to hold the grief of so many of the people i care for who are in mourning and at the same time i have so much grief for the ways this violence this atrocity is now being enacted in my name grossman said but on an even deeper level honestly just as a parent as a mom i just feel so heartbroken for me that s where the clarity and the desire for a cease fire comes from yet voices of caution let alone advocacy for palestinians are rare among establishment jewish institutions and commentators over the days and weeks ahead the israel defense forces will take decisive actions to destroy the terrorist threat from gaza read from the conference of presidents of major american jewish organizations which represents 50 large influential israel like all other nations has both the right and responsibility to protect its citizens this military

have been dancing on nuance it s going to be really really hard it is an important which side are you on moment elliot cosgrove rabbi of park avenue synagogue a large and influential congregation in manhattan during an oct 21 shabbat service that israel has an obligation to defend its citizens it is not complicated though he jewish law counsels against excessive bloodlust he argued that responsibility for civilian palestinian deaths lies with hamas he also argued that israel is being held to a different standard than any other nation when it comes to conduct in war a purported difference he attributed to antisemitism that argument that criticism of israeli military tactics or indeed of zionism itself is antisemitic has fueled perhaps the most bitter disagreements among american jews since the war started and last month the anti defamation league a civil rights group whose research on far right extremists and antisemites has long been a resource for journalists and jewish community leaders crystallized the debate in an attack against two of the most active jewish groups calling for a cease fire after the groups ifnotnow and jewish voice for peace two organizations that campaign for an end to what they argue is an ethnonationalist apartheid system in israel held a pro cease fire rally and sit in at the u s capitol adl ceo jonathan greenblatt to the groups as the photo inverse of white supremacists a year ago he used a referring to students for justice in palestine jewish voice for peace and the council on american islamic relations as the radical left the photo inverse of the extreme right that adl long has tracked at least one adl staffer stephen rea resigned over greenblatt s comment to it as throwing red meat to the people who want to do the most harm he the organization has done great work but that he couldn t square my morals and politics with the direction i saw the org going in stefanie fox the executive director of jewish voice for peace said the adl s attacks don t mean a lot next to the stakes of what s on the line right now the best way to honor all those lost is to insist that no further lives are lost especially when millions of palestinian lives are on the line she said lorber the antisemitism researcher is also a member of jewish voice for peace and ifnotnow he took issue with greenblatt s description referring to it as a shocking betrayal of reality a civil rights organization would be standing with protestors and saying regardless of whether we agree with you your civil rights deserve protection and the adl is not living up to that task in this moment he said the right is looking for excuses to demonize progressives to paint civil rights activists with a broad brush as dangerous antisemitic extremists and that carries real world consequences in the suppression of our speech the adl is adding fuel to that fire in a to huffpost an adl spokesperson referenced greenblatt s comparing far right threats to category 5 hurricanes while antisemitism from the far left was more akin to climate change slow subtle but steadily rising largely unnoticed until the disaster is already upon us adl has long defended free speech and the right of people to express even odious views the statement added but we certainly will call out when those protests cross lines and are organized by groups that take extreme positions positions that include blaming israel as the for the massacre of jews by the antisemitic terrorist organization hamas though they have reliably supported democrats more often than republicans in the past american jews are not a political monolith particularly on questions of israel palestine prime minister benjamin netanuyahu and other israeli leaders have cozied up to the american right in recent years and reflect a different attitude toward israel among young people now facing a historically bloody war a simmering divide over support of the israeli government among american jews is coming to the fore in july 2021 as recently 58 of jewish voters responding to a jewish electorate institute supported restricting u s aid to israel so that the country could not spend the money on expanding settlements in the west bank roughly a quarter agreed that israel is an apartheid state and 22 agreed that israel is committing genocide against the palestinians according to a conducted from july 16 2021 until jan 5 2022 42 of american jews either agreed or strongly agreed with the goals of the boycott divest sanction movement though just 23 supported the of the movement the poll also found that 51 of american jews believed u s support for palestinians should be increased while only 26 believed the same for israel the poll was conducted by carleton university political science professor mira sucharov who shared the results with huffpost she used a disseminating a survey link by email to a network of jewish organizations in the united states as well as by social media the responses of 2 298 self identifying jewish americans were weighed against pew research center s 2020 on variables including age gender region income partisan identification and jewish ancestry well before oct 7 some jewish intellectuals saw an opportunity to widen the lens of debate about israel there s much more openness to the analysis of the jewish left at this moment arielle angel editor in chief of jewish currents a left wing publication that relaunched in 2018 in june during a discussion on the future of jewish dissent angel said jewish currents had been receiving invitations from synagogues and jewish community centers generally older more conservative audiences than the magazine s readership in the past we would have been shouted down and now people on the panel are more inclined to have to answer us and even to agree with us at least to cede the premise that we are in an anti democratic paradigm in israel she said jewish voice for peace which organized the pro cease fire demonstrations in d c and at grand central is itself explicitly anti zionist its vision for the region as jewish israelis joining palestinians to build a just society rooted in equality rather than supremacy but fox the group s executive director said the immediate focus of the protests was a cease fire not long term political goals we are not saying come agree with every single thing we are saying or have said fox said we are saying right now come with your disagreement your anger your confusion your grief bring it all the only thing you have to agree to is that there is no military solution and that we must end it now cease fire now in this moment the thing that gives me a lot of hope are those who are willing to hold their questions confusion and disagreement while they also move into action to stop the israeli government s unfolding genocide of palestinians she added that strategy is drawing large numbers on oct 18 thousands of protesters converged on washington d c to call for a cease fire and another 500 people were arrested as part of a sit in in the u s capitol including a couple dozen rabbis fox told huffpost it was the largest event in jvp s history a few days later the protest at grand central terminal drew twice as many people as the d c event and resulted in the arrest of 350 participants fox said as sit in participants were released one by one from law enforcement custody late friday an accordionist played klezmer music and jail support volunteers cheered and handed out challah to a new generation of jewish peace activists the display was part of a long lineage of such activism including at grand central some on the jewish left are wary of the effectiveness of organizing as jews rather than as part of larger multi group coalitions as lorber put it american jews don t really set the terms for u s foreign policy around israel palestine i think those are increasingly set by the christian right christian zionists by defense contractors and by u s political leaders and their geopolitical interests others worry about taking attention away from the urgent suffering of palestinians still for jews anxieties abound the spike in antisemitism around the globe is undeniable and includes on synagogues and a the in russia in response to an incoming flight from tel aviv in paris and aimed at students at cornell university and elsewhere in grand central terminal a man assaulted a woman because as he you are jewish a nevada man was arrested monday for leaving voicemails for sen jacky rosen d nev threatening to finish what hitler started and outright bigots aside some protest language following the oct 7 hamas attack has been callous at best exemplified by the but still number of purported pro palestinian intellectuals and activists who ve attempted to justify or even celebrate hamas killing of civilians on the academic grounds that resistance to colonial oppression can take many forms the justification or even just the passing over without comment of what was a really horrifying display of inhumanity by hamas is very costly said editor at large at jewish currents and a professor of journalism and politics at cuny who has studied the region for decades beinart like many american jews huffpost spoke to said he was feeling devastated the ability to create a sense of common struggle based on common humanity and a recognition of the infinite preciousness of both palestinian and jewish life it seems like it s been dealt a very serious blow he said and it s become much more difficult to be in anything like the mainstream american jewish community and also be someone who s actively working for palestinian freedom still he and others have found hope in solidarity beinart has the pro palestinian left to advocate for the release of israeli hostages and for the israeli government to prisoners who aren t affiliated with hamas valley the artist who was arrested at grand central said he could find little hope for the future in the past three weeks save for one thing the to the action at grand central was encouraging because some muslim americans and palestinians they ve been really isolated and they were genuinely appreciative of the concept that they re not objects of total dehumanization by at least some people he said standing at the police barricade friday night nour chamoun who is palestinian tallied the people she knew who had family and friends dying in gaza a friend of mine just had 40 members of her family killed she said we re seeing a televised genocide happening live in front of us for chamoun like so many others the future seems bleak but she added the display of solidarity at grand central was truly meaningful honestly i feel very very grateful to have solidarity from a lot of non arabs she said the jewish community has really shown up and put their bodies on the line and i hope more folks come forward and speak out as they see more

00:00:00,denver ap the effort to ban former president from the ballot under turned to distant history on wednesday when a law professor testified about how the post civil war provision was indeed intended to apply to presidential candidates gerard magliocca of indiana university said there was scant scholarship on section three of the 14th amendment when he began researching it in late 2020 he testified that he uncovered evidence in 150 year old court rulings congressional testimony and presidential executive orders that it applied to presidents and to those who simply encouraged an insurrection rather than physically participated in one magliocca didn t mention trump by name but the plaintiffs in the case have argued that colorado must ban him from the ballot because in the jan 6 2021 which was intended to halt congress certification of and falls under the provision the section originally was designed to prevent former confederates from returning to their old federal and state jobs and taking over the government it was not intended as punishment magliocca said of the ban a number of senators discussed the fact that this was simply adding another qualification to office trump s attorneys on wednesday moved for an immediate ruling dismissing the case because they said the plaintiffs had not proved that trump incited the jan 6 riot saying all his actions were legal speech district court judge sarah b wallace denied the motion noting that many of the legal questions raised during the hearing have never been addressed by a court before and that she ll rule on them later trump s attorneys have condemned the lawsuit as anti democratic and warned that using an obscure provision to disqualify the republican front runner would be antithetical to the traditions of the world s oldest democracy on tuesday night trump slammed the colorado proceedings in a video posted to his social media site truth social a fake trial is currently taking place to try and illegally remove my name from the ballot trump said in a reference to president joe biden he added if crooked joe and the democrats get away with removing my name from the ballot then there will

congress granted amnesty to many former confederates who had previously been barred by it that section bars anyone from congress the military and federal and state offices if they previously took an oath to support the constitution and have engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the same or given aid or comfort to the enemies thereof it does not specifically name the office of president but instead reads elector of president and vice president trump s attorneys began putting on their case wednesday afternoon calling former administration officials kash patel and katrina pierson to testify that trump had told them he wanted as many as 10 000 national guard ready to deal with any violence on jan 6 the troops were never mobilized and that request is not in the timeline of that day issued by the department of defense the plaintiff s attorneys noted that pierson told the congressional jan 6 committee that one main concern was the safety of pro trump protesters not the capitol on tuesday a legal expert testified for the plaintiffs that trump could have mobilized federal resources to aid the capitol in the hours after the protest turned violent that followed nearly two days of testimony about the jan 6 riot and trump s relationship with right wing extremists but wednesday got to what makes the challenge against trump s ability to run for office novel the case that have rarely if ever been aired in courtrooms before the jan 6 attack does congress need to create a mechanism to implement the ban does it apply to the presidency especially since an earlier draft specified that office but then it was removed what constitutes an insurrection under its definition there s been an explosion of legal scholarship in recent months trying to figure that out going through dictionaries and court rulings from the mid 19th century magliocca contended that the ban was implemented even without any congressional procedure that senators noted it applied to the president and that the definition of an insurrection was simply a large scale effort to impede the execution of laws critics have warned that if the provision is used to bar trump that could open the door to other more conventional politicians getting banned for activities such as supporting protests against police brutality or other forms of civil disobedience trump s team is scheduled to call their own law professor to argue that the provision doesn t apply to him legal scholars believe the measure was cited just once in the 20th century as justification for congress not seating an anti

administration is developing a national strategy to combat islamophobia as the white house faces skepticism from many muslim americans for its staunch support of israel s on hamas in gaza plans for the initiative which the white house billed as the first of its kind were announced wednesday it is meant to bring together lawmakers advocacy groups and other community leaders with the administration in order to counter the scourge of islamophobia and hate in all its forms the white house said moving forward the president vice president and our entire administration will continue working to ensure every american has the freedom to live their lives in safety and without fear for how they pray what they believe and who they are white house press secretary karine jean pierre said in a statement announcing the strategy the white house originally was expected to announce its plans to develop the strategy last week when biden met with muslim leaders but that was delayed according to three people familiar with the matter two said the delay was due partly to concerns from muslim americans that the administration lacked credibility on the issue given its robust backing of israel s military whose strikes against hamas militants have killed thousands of civilians in gaza the people spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to publicly discuss the white house plans the launch of the anti islamophobia effort has been anticipated for months after the administration in may that made passing reference to countering hatred against muslims the new initiative is expected to take months to formalize following a similar process to the plan to counter antisemitism that involved various government agencies white house spokeswoman emilie simons said wednesday that the interagency group s next step is to release a strategy on islamophobia she did not offer details on a timeline for the effort incidences of anti jewish and anti muslim hate have skyrocketed in the united states and abroad since the surprise oct 7 attack by hamas against israel that killed more than 1 400 people and saw hundreds taken hostage and israel s response in gaza where it has pledged to use force to destroy hamas one of the most prominent attacks in the u s was the and the wounding of his mother in an attack in illinois that prosecutors allege was driven by islamophobia this horrific act of hate has no place in america and stands against our fundamental values freedom from fear for how we pray what we believe and who we are biden said afterward there had been widespread agreement among muslim americans on the need for a national strategy to counter islamophobia according to a fourth person familiar with the matter who added that the israel hamas war has made the timing of the white house announcement more complicated the person who was also not authorized to speak publicly about the internal deliberations said the administration wants to keep the two issues separate while some prominent muslim american groups see them as interrelated administration officials during the meeting with a small group of faith leaders last week indicated things were in the works for an anti islamophobia strategy said rami nashashibi the founder of the inner city muslim action network in chicago and a participant in that session nashashibi said he believed such an effort would be dead on arrival with the muslim community until the president and administration officials forcefully condemn members of the far right government of israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu who have openly called for the eradication of palestinians from gaza and until the administration more aggressively calls out hate crimes targeting muslims and arab americans he and other leaders also want biden to apologize or at least publicly clarify his recent comments in which he said he had no confidence in the palestinian death count from israel s retaliatory strikes because the data comes from the hamas run health ministry the united nations and other international institutions and experts as well as palestinian authorities in the west bank rivals of hamas say the has long made a good faith effort to account for the dead under the most difficult conditions in previous wars the ministry s counts have held up to u n scrutiny independent investigations and even israel s tallies white house national security council spokesman john kirby said tuesday that the administration is not taking the ministry of health at face value but he acknowledged there have been many thousands of civilian deaths in gaza in the conflict nashashibi also said the white house strategy could land flat at a moment when many muslim americans feel that advocacy stands for palestinian self determination is being unfairly lumped in with those espousing antisemitism and backing of extremists that conflating is in great part contributing to an atmosphere where we could see even more deadly results and more targeting he said nashashibi added the white house does not have the credibility to roll out an islamophobia strategy at this moment without publicly addressing the points we explicitly raised with the president during our meeting asked if the white house had a credibility issue simons the spokeswoman said the administration would continue its outreach efforts we know that communities are feeling the pain of what s going on overseas and in a deeply personal way simons said and so we re going to continue to speak to these different communities underscore the work we re doing to get aid into gaza and the conditions we re trying to set up to support a humanitarian pause __ associated press writer chris megerian from aboard air force one contributed to this report

that a bout of weakness in barkan s left hand was an early symptom of als barkan then 32 had already achieved acclaim for pioneering work in the field of progressive organizing in 2012 two years after graduating yale law school barkan was hired at the center for popular democracy a network of low income grassroots advocacy organizations he became the point person for cpd s burgeoning local progress initiative which created a first of its kind forum for left leaning local elected officials from across the country what began as a small program with three founding city officials grew to a network of over 1 000 people across the country under barkan s leadership the group played a pivotal role in the passage of in new york city in 2013 and the of a 15 minimum wage in seattle the following year an essay by encouraging progressives to take the effects of the federal reserve s monetary policy more seriously inspired barkan to start his own venture under cpd s auspices barkan became convinced that the fed s bias toward creditors over workers and borrowers was at least partly the product of an the central bank tended to hike interest rates out of excessive vigilance against inflation a problem that hurts lenders bottom line but maintained a more blasé attitude about the depressing effect of those interest rate hikes on the job market when barkan pitched his superiors on the idea that the cpd could transform its network of low income worker activists into the first ever progressive grassroots federal reserve lobbying force they were initially skeptical barkan emphasized the ways that black and latino workers who suffer from significantly higher unemployment rates than white americans are especially vulnerable to fluctuations in the job market but it was hard to envision teaching ordinary people enough about the fed s impact on their lives let alone strategize ways to impact the notoriously secretive and elite central bank barkan persisted developing a plan of action and forming the fed up coalition which had its national debut at the federal reserve bank of kansas city s annual symposium in jackson hole wyoming in august 2014 where finance reporters were treated to the spectacle of green shirted workers confronting senior fed officials with their concerns it was all part of barkan s appetite for taking on unlikely fights and making his own odds with a blend of wonkish idealism and sheer determination and it reflected an institutionalist optimism that has fallen out of fashion in some quarters of the left a belief that even the country s most elite institutions could be penetrated by the right social movement ady had that instinct still that you don t give up on the institutions that you can go in there and work smith said he had an ability to bridge that gap from the activist left and progressive organizers and still feel comfortable working with the institutions and people that the left broadly might feel antagonistic towards and saying no you can go in there and talk reason to people and make them see you sure enough though barkan was comfortable pursuing long term goals without the promise of an immediate payoff fed up got tangible results in relatively short order the group would eventually secure audiences with every fed decision maker including then fed chairwoman janet yellen fed up s greatest policy successes were in increasing pressure on the central bank and congress to push the fed in a more racially and socioeconomically diverse direction it was in that climate that raphael bostic was named the first black president of a regional federal reserve bank taking the helm in atlanta in 2017 what had been missing from previous expert driven efforts to nudge the fed in a more progressive direction was the humanizing power of a flesh and blood social movement barkan s personality and experience equipped him to engineer the force that would fill that gap ady not only recognized a deep problem that had been around for decades but he managed to do something about it in a way that i never imagined jared bernstein a member of president joe biden s council of economic advisers told huffpost in 2017 we ve written academic papers and we ve complained about some of the metrics they used but he did something about it and has been way more influential than people realize the fall of 2016 was devastating for barkan not only because of the als diagnosis he described in his 2019 memoir eyes to the wind as a death sentence during her 2016 campaign for president hillary clinton had many of fed up s recommended reforms embracing a call to get bankers off the boards of regional federal reserve banks a victory for clinton would have meant a unique chance for barkan and his team to mold policy her unexpected loss was especially shattering for barkan my world had already fallen apart and i wasn t sure how i would tolerate this second blow barkan wrote in his memoir after a year of reflection with family pursuit of experimental medical treatments and continued work for fed up barkan finally developed a firmer idea of how he would respond to als hoping to use every ounce of waning strength in his body to fight the trump administration s policies he traveled to washington in december 2017 to engage in civil disobedience to protest the white house s tax cuts standing outside the office of rep darrell issa a california republican barkan the tax cuts as a direct threat to his health and that of his family since the budget busting bill could trigger automatic cuts to social programs and would undoubtedly increase pressure to balance the budget on the backs of sick and vulnerable people refusing to move from his position obstructing the entrance barkan propping himself up with a cane was arrested for the first time in his life but an airplane ride back from washington to his home in santa barbara california would prove far more influential than that first round of civil disobedience on capitol hill barkan ended up boarding a connecting flight to phoenix on which then sen jeff flake r ariz was also a passenger barkan invited flake to chat with him about the tax cuts during the flight and flake obliged leading to a in which barkan exposed flake s priorities you can be an american hero barkan implored flake progressive strategist liz jaff who was also on the flight filmed their exchange and posted it to twitter turning barkan and his mission to put a human face on the movement to stop the tax cuts into an overnight sensation the whole world is finally seeing this person who i ve had this intense privilege to know and love and work with over the years johnson remembered thinking noting how it exemplified his total wonkery and seriousness about the content his courage his willingness to engage in direct confrontation but to do it actually in this way that kind of invites people in smith believes that were it not for barkan s moral convictions and confidence in his own reasoning power the interaction would not have been the game changing event that it became to end up on that plane with jeff flake is total serendipity on the one hand but on the other hand ady is the unstoppable force that met the right moment smith said barkan returned to the capitol several times to risk arrest while protesting the tax cuts each time joined by a steadily larger contingent of allies his uphill crusade to stop the tax cuts failed but he laid the foundation for an enduring progressive political organization that put real people and their stories at the center of technical policy debates but barkan was animated by more than just a commitment to use his last moments to advance the cause of justice even amid deep personal pain he recognized that he was fortunate to enjoy the privilege of being white upper middle class and now famous in a country riven by racism and inequality as an organizer it just wasn t his instinct to make himself part of the story lander said once he got there once he realized that it was important for him to center his own story in these fights he became a really good organizer of his own story rather than deny himself the perks associated with his growing influence barkan at once took advantage of his platform to ease his personal situation and to call attention to the injustice of a system that required such privilege to obtain essential medical care when barkan s insurance company initially refused to cover a breathing machine that barkan needed to help him sleep he into submission with a viral tweet in january 2018 i m confident that my insurer would not have moved so quickly if i did not have a big twitter following he told huffpost at the time i know millions of people are denied necessary care every year even though they are entitled to it that s a pretty unjust way to run a health care system in april 2018 barkan founded the a name inspired by his plea to flake to promote his political agenda and leverage his name and story to raise money for political candidates directly one of his first beneficiaries was democrat hiral tipirneni an arizona doctor competing in a special election for an open house seat with limited support from the national democratic party accompanied by a camera operator barkan traveled to arizona and tipirneni s republican opponent debbie lesko about how republicans planned to use the trump tax cuts as an opportunity to cut social security medicare and medicaid the be a hero fund followed up his with lesko with a six figure ad campaign framing the special election as an opportunity to protect health care from the spending cuts that the trump tax bill was likely to unleash tipirneni lost by but her strong performance inspired national democrats to her 2020 run in a different district later that year when sen susan collins r maine was considering whether to vote in favor of brett kavanaugh s supreme court nomination despite allegations that kavanaugh had attempted to rape a woman in high school barkan an effort to crowdfund money for a challenger in 2020 if collins voted to confirm kavanaugh collins voted yes but thanks in part to barkan s work anyone considering challenging her would have had no trouble raising campaign funds the initiative provided maine house speaker sara gideon collins unsuccessful democratic challenger the defeats that barkan endured in so many of the high profile battles he took on following his als diagnosis the passed tax cuts kavanaugh s confirmation collins reelection did not dull his appetite to effect change in that way barkan s approach to politics mirrored his attitude toward the illness steadily sucking the life out of him even when the odds of victory were slim to none he believed the fight itself gave him meaning and inspired those around him on those days when it s hard for us to get out of bed you just think if ady is organizing today i can get up and organize today lander told huffpost in january 2021 even as barkan s strength withered in the ensuing years by 2020 he was communicating through a text to voice computer program that tracked his eye movements his status as a progressive folk hero only increased in april 2019 barkan before the first ever congressional hearing on medicare for all describing how out of pocket health care costs of 9 000 a month had forced him to crowdfund assistance from friends family and supporters he recounted how he and his wife rachael scarborough king had spent hours of their remaining time together fighting with their insurer some people argue that although medicare for all is a great idea we need to move slowly to get there he said but i needed medicare for all yesterday thanks to his prominence and the respect that his work elicited democratic presidential candidates courted his blessing during the prolonged battle over who would take on trump barkan welcomed the large field of democratic presidential candidates to sit down with him at his home in santa barbara for recorded interviews that focused on their views about health care in general and medicare for all in particular barkan s eventual preference in the presidential primary would embody his belief in the importance of using institutional tools and expertise to enact transformative change while sen elizabeth warren s announcement that she would enact medicare for all in two separate stages some on the left barkan rallied to her side at a critical moment during her ultimately unsuccessful bid announcing in november 2019 i believe that she more than any other person in america has the skills the temperament and the knowledge to lead us toward a more just and equitable future he wrote in although then presidential candidate joe biden declined to meet with barkan during the primary he sat for an emotional in july 2020 they acknowledged their disagreement on medicare for all but barkan went on to shortly thereafter calling on his fellow left wing voters who preferred other candidates to do the same he is everything trump is not compassionate intelligent and committed to the public interest barkan said in his video endorsement barkan addressed a television audience of millions during the democratic national convention in august 2020 sharing a with the existential threat of another four years of this president barkan said we all have a profound obligation to act not only to vote but to make sure that our friends family and neighbors vote as well ohad ady barkan was born on dec 18 1983 his mother a romanian jew met his father tel aviv native after she moved to israel in the 1970s the couple moved to the united states where ady was born and became history professors they divorced and both remarried while he was still a boy in the process barkan got a step brother zach from his mother s second marriage and half brother muki from his father s second marriage barkan was raised in a secular jewish household but has described his appreciation of judaism s social justice tradition exemplified by the value of tikkun olam or repairing the world as a young man growing up in southern california smith saw in barkan an early passion for correcting injustice when ady sees authority being used in ways that are cruel or unfair he can t let it go he s like a dog with a bone smith said the rest of us have a certain tolerance for bullshit he continued we understand that you re going to run into some assholes and some of those assholes are going to have power over you most of us kind of accommodate ourselves to it in one way or another ady never would initially barkan s indignation took the form of objecting to the way a teacher was grading exams or a coach was running a scrimmage game then one day smith saw barkan in his car and stopped to see where he was headed i was just looking for a ride home and he said get in we re canvassing for gay rights smith recalled as a high school student barkan traversed the eastern reaches of los angeles county seeking to drum up opposition to a that would prevent california from recognizing same sex marriages performed in other states the ballot measure prop 22 ended up but he was ahead of the curve on an lgbtq rights revolution that would sweep california and the rest of the country a decade later barkan carried his passion for social justice to college at columbia university where he met his future wife and fellow college newspaper staffer rachael as a student barkan played a major role in efforts to ensure that the workers in developing countries who made the university s branded apparel were paid a living wage and had safe working conditions barkan went on to law school at yale fueled by the same idealism that had animated his youth he volunteered at an immigrant worker rights legal clinic spending countless hours interviewing restaurant workers about the wage theft they had endured and assembling a legal case to win them the money they were owed he also became active in a law student group pushing western governments and pharmaceutical companies to make essential drugs such as those used to treat hiv and aids available at affordable rates in developing nations those experiences by turns exhilarated and frustrated barkan who soon discovered both the limits of direct aid to workers of the kind offered by the clinic and the slow pace of change sought by affordable medicine advocates political change i began to learn was only achievable through sustained struggle which required sustainable and powerful institutions that could continue pursuing their objectives for many years he wrote in his memoir barkan s own journey to carve out a niche in those institutions began with a year long post law school fellowship at make the road new york an immigrant rights organization barkan used his fluent spanish and experience at the yale clinic to represent immigrant workers who were subject to illegal exploitation prior to joining the center for popular democracy in 2012 barkan spent a year clerking for federal judge shira scheindlin a civil libertarian known for striking down the new york city police department s in august 2013 barkan helped draft scheindlin s may 2012 decision granting to the plaintiffs challenging the practice an early victory for civil liberties advocates on the road to a fuller vindication the following year he was always thinking outside the box and seeing where we could push the envelope a little bit not one of those who was just tied to precedent and never thought about what we might be able to do scheindlin told huffpost in 2017 although the final years of barkan s life were consumed with serious minded political work barkan never lost his dry sense of humor or stopped enjoying life s pleasures sharing with his children and joking about his with his legion social media followers barkan is survived by his wife rachael son carl and daughter willow he leaves behind a community of activists organizers and lawmakers bound by the love and shared sense of purpose his life instilled in them as well as a trove of videos photos essays and articles documenting his work rachael hopes the abundant media cataloguing barkan s journey can bring his vision alive for their children after he is gone one of the gifts of this moment right now is now we re gonna have a lot of artifacts of ady engaged in progressive politics she told huffpost in 2017 barkan s impact is already being commemorated in more formal ways in 2019 local progress created the for outstanding work in local government and the progressive news outlet the intercept crowdfunded a in barkan s honor lander told huffpost in january 2021 that when the united states finally ensures universal health care it will be the biggest part of his legacy but barkan s influence extends beyond politics he shared the experience of dying from als with the world modeling how one person can come to grips with their deadly illness of all the injustices that barkan confronted the honesty and bravery with which he greeted his own tragedy the painful and inexorable march of als may have been his greatest triumph we re all going to die smith said we re all going to follow him down that path and in some ways he s wrestling with those questions for us catching himself smith paused and modified his remarks he hasn t just wrestled with it smith said he s in a losing battle and yet in the face of that to continue and make that assertion of life and to live abundantly even under that shadow it s powerful stuff

the Supreme Court takes the case, it will be the first time the highest court has weighed in on gender-affirming care for minors.",Lil Kalish,2023-11-01 00:00:00,the american civil liberties union of tennessee petitioned the u s supreme court to take up a case involving the state s ban on gender affirming care for transgender youth in the petition filed wednesday the aclu is asking the supreme court to review a decision from the u s court of appeals for the 6th circuit that allowed the tennessee ban to go into effect the aclu is arguing that the state s ban violates the 14th amendment s equal protection clause and the rights of parents to make medical decisions for their children if it takes the case it would be the first time the country s highest court has weighed in on restrictions for gender affirming care for transgender youth the aclu first brought the case l w v skrmetti against the state of tennessee this spring on behalf of the families of three minors and a memphis based doctor a federal judge granted those families a preliminary injunction blocking the law in june but the 6th circuit overturned that ruling in september allowing the ban in tennessee plus a similar ban in kentucky to stay in effect the tennessee law senate bill 1 currently bars transgender individuals younger than 18 from seeking out gender affirming care such as puberty blockers or hormone therapy patients who were already receiving care before july will have to phase out treatments by march 2024 however the aclu medical providers and families of transgender youth in the state say that the law has already affected patients who began gender affirming care prior to the enforcement of the ban vanderbilt university medical center one of the state s largest providers of gender affirming care stopped treating all patients younger than 16 in july according to one health care provider at vanderbilt who previously spoke to huffpost the medical center has also canceled surgeries for cisgender adolescents that could be seen as pathways to gender affirmation the medical center where two of the three plaintiffs in the case received care was the subject of a social media attack last year by right wing blogger matt walsh who falsely alleged that vanderbilt was castrating and sterilizing children state attorney general john skrmetti started investigating vanderbilt last summer and requested scores of patient medical records the medical center s decision to release records has been widely criticized and is now part of a federal civil rights investigation it scares me to think about losing the medication that i need and if this law continues my family may have to leave tennessee the place i have lived and loved my entire life said l w a 15 year old transgender girl and one of the youths represented by the aclu in a statement i want the justices to know transgender people are not going away and that we deserve the same rights as everyone else earlier this year the aclu found success in blocking bans on gender affirming care and other anti lgbtq bills across the country in june for example a federal court struck down arkansas first in the nation ban on gender affirming care following a two week trial but as cases have moved up to higher courts many of these initial wins have been overturned by federal judges who were nominated by former president donald trump the 6th circuit decision on the tennessee and kentucky bans and an 11th circuit ruling on an alabama ban on gender affirming care both cite arguments central to the supreme court s decision in dobbs v jackson women s health organization which overturned the federal right to abortion the court argued in that ruling that abortion wasn t deeply rooted in the history and tradition of the united states and thus wasn t protected by the 14th amendment that same logic is being used on bans for gender affirming care tennessee s ban and the challenge to it comes amid a rising culture of right wing hostility and attempts to erase trans people from public life with trans youth often at the center tennessee is just one of 21 states that have passed bans on gender affirming care for youth during a year of record high anti lgbtq legislation and rising violence against queer and trans communities so far in 2023 state legislatures have introduced more than 500 anti lgbtq bills not

the mayors of chicago denver houston los angeles and new york are pressing to meet with president about getting federal help in managing the surge of migrants they say are arriving in their cities with little to no coordination support or resources from his administration the democratic leaders say in a letter obtained by the associated press on wednesday that while they appreciate biden s efforts so far much more needs to be done to ease the burden on their cities migrants are sleeping in police station foyers in chicago in new york a cruise ship terminal was turned into a shelter in denver the number of migrants arriving has increased tenfold and available space to shelter them has withered with fewer available work authorizations these migrants cannot find work that would allow them to get into proper housing who is leading the coalition said nearly every conversation he has had with arriving migrants is the same can he help them find a job they ask the crisis is we have folks here who desperately want to work and we have employers here who desperately want to hire them and we have a federal government that s standing in the way of employers who want to hire employees who want to work johnston said also signing on were the mayors of the country s four largest cities eric adams of new york karen bass of los angeles brandon johnson of chicago and sylvester turner of houston the situation at the u s mexico border has vexed who is seeking reelection in 2024 he is increasingly under fire from members of his own party who are managing the growing number of migrants in their cities claim biden is soft on border security and is allowing too many people to enter the united states he has responded and by offering work authorizations and other incentives to those who come to the u s legally applying ahead of time and arriving by plane the reason in these cities is complicated but economic and climate related hardships in their home countries are key drivers there are increasing numbers of families arriving and asking for asylum some conservative leaning states such as new york or chicago where laws are more favorable to noncitizens but that alone does not explain why the cities are facing such increases in years past when migrants arrived they would be released and picked up by nonprofit groups before usually going to stay with a relative already in the u s but the nationalities of the people arriving have changed and many no longer have any place to go winning asylum is a long and difficult process through a badly clogged immigration court system in some cases migrants they are released into the u s to wait some are eligible to work but such authorizations are badly delayed there are concerns too that allowing too much work authorization will encourage more people to make the dangerous journey to the u s on foot so thousands are in limbo unable to work sleeping in shelters or government facilities from congress to help state and local governments provide shelter and services for migrants after earlier pleas from democratic mayors and governors johnston and the other mayors say in their letter that more is needed and they are asking for 5 billion while we are greatly appreciative of the additional federal funding proposed our city budgets and local taxpayers continue to bear the brunt of this ongoing federal crisis the letter says cities have historically absorbed and integrated new migrants with success denver is spending 2 million a week on sheltering migrants new york has surpassed a total of 1 7 billion and chicago has spent 320 million according to the letter our cities need additional resources that far exceed the amount proposed in order to properly care for the asylum seekers entering our communities the mayors letter says relying on municipal budgets is not sustainable and has forced us to cut essential city services the mayors also want an accelerated work authorization approval process so migrants can find work we are extremely appreciative of the work the biden harris administration has done in expanding work authorization and providing funding for this mission but we need to go one step further to ensure we continue to meet the moment and provide care for new arrivals johnson s office said in a statement the cities are full of people who have applied but there are delays of six months or more the mayors also are pushing to expand authorizations so anyone released into the u s would become eligible to find work while they wait for their immigration cases to play out lastly they are asking for the administration to create a regional migration coordinator who would work with the federal government nonprofits and state and local officials the aim is to better coordinate and place migrants in areas where there is capacity for them it s unclear whether congress including the republican controlled house will pass any of the funding biden has requested let alone a increase for local support we think there is a real commonsense path here that and that s why we thought it was important johnston said

Asadu,2023-10-31 00:00:00,abuja nigeria ap law enforcement authorities in nigeria are using the country s same sex prohibition law to target the lgbtq community while ignoring abuses against them rights groups and lawyers say in the wake of fresh mass arrests of gay people where homosexuality is criminalized in laws that are broadly supported by the public even though the constitution guarantees freedom from discrimination and the right to private and family life mass arrests and detention of queer nigerians that continued this week were done without proper investigations and could further expose them to danger amid the anti lgbtq sentiments in africa s most populous country rights groups said the country s paramilitary agency on monday announced the arrest of more than 70 young people 59 men and 17 women in the northern gombe state accusing them of holding homosexual birthdays and having the intention to hold a same sex marriage following a at what the police called a gay wedding in the southern delta state in august the arrests show an uptick in this trend of witchhunt and gross violation of human rights of the individuals isa sanusi director of amnesty international nigeria told the associated press the arrests also suggest states are emulating one another to get accolades under the law according to anietie ewang nigerian researcher with the human rights watch s africa division she said concerns highlighted by the organization in a 2016 report about the abuse and stigma that gay people face in nigeria have remained which has been condemned internationally but is supported by many in the country of more than 210 million people punishes gay marriage with up to 14 years in prison and has forced many nigerian gays to flee the country according to human rights activists have been common since it came into effect but the largest mass detentions yet have been in recent weeks in which some of the suspects were falsely accused and subjected to inhumane conditions according to lawyers and rights groups after dozens were arrested at what the police called a gay wedding in a delta state hotel the suspects were paraded in front of cameras in a live social media broadcast despite a ruling by a nigerian high court last year that pretrial media parades violate the nation s constitution one of those paraded said he was at the hotel for another engagement another suspect said he does not identify as a gay individual and was arrested while on his way to a fashion show in gombe where the nigeria security and civil defence corps nscdc said its personnel arrested people who intended to organize a gay wedding the prime suspect identified as bashir sani denied the allegation there was no wedding only birthday he said in a broadcast aired by local media among those arrested were the photographer and the disc jockey at the event ochuko ohimor the suspects lawyer told the associated press it is part of a trend that shows how the anti gay law is being exploited without due process said okechukwu nwanguma who leads the rule of law and accountability advocacy centre which advocates for police reforms in nigeria one evidence of such a flawed process lawyers said is the failed trial of the 47 men arrested in 2018 and charged with public displays of affection for members of same sex at a hotel in lagos a local court dismissed the case in 2020 because of what it described as the lack of diligent prosecution after the police failed to present some witnesses they law enforcement authorities are exploiting the law to target people whether or not they are queer there is a tendency to target them based on assumptions or allegations not based on any investigation said nwanguma such blanket arrests and media parade are not only discriminatory but also pose a high risk of further endangering people for their real or perceived sexual or gender orientation said amnesty international s sanusi since the signing of same sex prohibition act into law in 2014 attacks harassment blackmail and extortion of the lgbtq community is rising at disturbing speed the nigeria police should be prioritizing keeping everyone safe not stoking more discrimination he said police spokespersons at the nigeria police force headquarters and at the delta state command did not respond to enquiries from the ap to speak on the arrests and on the allegations about the lack of due process in handling such cases lawyers also spoke to the ap about instances where the police failed to act in handling cases of abuse against the lgbtq community in nigeria in 2020 david bakare a gay person petitioned the police about a group of men who beat him up after he shared a video of himself dancing the suspects were freed on bail after which they continued to threaten bakare to withdraw the petition a copy of which his lawyer shared with the ap bakare then petitioned the police a second time to alert them that his life is in danger but no action was taken in response he said he had no choice but to flee to another part of lagos since you can t trust the police to do the necessary things those guys will come again the 26 year old said of his abusers the problem of delayed justice is not new in nigeria where as corrupt but it is far worse for groups such as the lgbtq community seen to be vulnerable said chizelu emejulu an activist and lawyer who has handled many cases involving queer people when we get the perpetrators arrested the consistent thing we have noticed is that people always claim their victims are queer and once they say that the police begin to withdraw from these cases said emejulu what the lgbtq community in nigeria is asking for is to be left alone to live their lives emejulu added

first person in massachusetts the second in new england to be executed for witchcraft decades before the nearly four centuries later the state and region are still working to come to grips with the scope of its witch trial legacy the latest effort comes from a group dedicated to clearing the names of all those accused arrested or indicted for witchcraft in massachusetts whether or not the accusations ended in hanging the massachusetts witch hunt justice project made up of history buffs and descendants is hoping to persuade the state to take a fuller reckoning of its early history according to josh hutchinson the group s leader hundreds of individuals were accused of witchcraft in what would become the commonwealth of massachusetts between 1638 and 1693 most escaped execution while much attention has focused on clearing the names of those put to death in salem most of those caught up in witch trials throughout the 1600s have largely been ignored including five women hanged for witchcraft in boston between 1648 and 1688 it s important that we correct the injustices of the past said hutchinson who noted he counts both accusers and victims among his ancestors we d like an apology for all of the accused or indicted or arrested for now the group has been collecting signatures for a petition but hopes to take their case to the statehouse among those accused of witchcraft in boston was ann hibbins sister in law to massachusetts gov richard bellingham who was executed in 1656 a character based on hibbins would later appear in nathaniel hawthorne s the scarlet letter published in 1850 another accused boston witch known as goodwife ann glover or goody glover was hanged in the city in 1688 a plaque dedicated to her is located on the front of a catholic church in the city s north end neighborhood describing her as the first catholic martyr in massachusetts it s one of the few physical reminders of the city s witch trial history the witch justice group helped successfully spearhead a similar effort in connecticut home of the first person executed for witchcraft in the american colonies in 1647 alse young the last witchcraft trial in connecticut happened in 1697 and ended with the charges being dismissed connecticut state senators in may convicted of witchcraft 11 of whom were executed more than 370 years ago and apologize for the miscarriage of justice

reprieve passed the house of representatives by a vote of 121 30 because it s a resolution it doesn t require the governor s signature for many the distant events in boston salem and beyond are both

accused who was supposed to be hanged in 1692 in salem but escaped execution we can t change history but maybe we can send the accused an apology he said it kind of closes the chapter in a way massachusetts has already made efforts to come to terms with its history of witch trials proceedings that allowed spectral evidence in which victims could testify that the accused harmed them in a dream or vision that effort began almost immediately when samuel sewall a judge in the 1692 1693 salem witch trials issued a public confession in a boston church five years later taking the blame and shame of the trials and asking for forgiveness in 1711 colonial leaders passed a bill clearing the names of some convicted in salem in 1957 the state legislature issued a kind of apology for ann pudeator and others who were indicted tried found guilty sentenced to death and executed in 1692 for witchcraft the resolution declared the salem trials shocking and the result of a wave of popular hysterical fear of the devil in the community in 2001 acting gov jane swift signed a bill exonerating in salem in 2017 salem unveiled the ceremony came 325 years to the day when sarah good elizabeth

s clinic remained open and their colleagues debated whether they were safe at work or should go home riley said local police were lined up outside the medical center s doors serving as extra security for employees all day people whispered about the social media posts by right wing blogger matt walsh which had gone viral the day before for claiming that doctors at vanderbilt s transgender health clinic castrate and sterilize children at the time riley hadn t heard of walsh they didn t have social media and rarely watched the news but over the next year riley would witness firsthand again and again how misinformation and right wing attacks on the transgender health clinic severely restricted the kinds of care they could provide at vanderbilt in those months trans tennesseans have felt more intimidated and desperate than ever as they have been forced to decide whether to pack up their lives to find a place where they can exist without the fear of the government or right wing provocateurs meddling in their private medical information one of the first changes riley saw was vanderbilt moving the stand alone transgender health clinic inside the university s main campus in nashville tennessee the clinic also adopted new security measures including an armed guard behind the desk and required patients and providers to be buzzed inside riley said the medical center has even canceled appointments for certain surgeries for cisgender youth that currently do not fall into the category of gender affirmation but that critics could see as pathways to gender affirmation by the end of september 2022 tennessee s attorney general john skrmetti said his office had opened an investigation into vanderbilt s transgender health clinic over the next few months skrmetti broadened the scope first requesting specific patient medical records and then information on vanderbilt employees and volunteers at the transgender health clinic the following spring republican gov bill lee signed a ban on gender affirming care for transgender children effectively suspending all operations at vumc s pediatric transgender clinic riley said they were one of more than a dozen clinicians who were told by skrmetti s office that their emails could be subpoenaed as part of the investigation it feels like a witch hunt riley told huffpost what are you going to find in my emails obviously there s not a conspiracy here in september 2022 walsh a prominent nashville based right wing talk show host and blogger accused vanderbilt university medical center s transgender health clinic of only existing to turn a profit he also claimed that vanderbilt doctors castrate sterilize and mutilate minors in a series of tweets walsh argued that the clinic was drugging and sterilizing children and used language that lgbtq advocates and vanderbilt employees say grossly distorted the reality of pediatric transgender care walsh posted a video of one vanderbilt doctor dr shayne taylor who founded the clinic in 2018 discussing how gender affirming surgeries like double mastectomies and genital surgeries could bring in a lot of money for the medical center in this video taylor who did not respond to huffpost s request for comment was mostly referencing surgeries for trans adults as vanderbilt never performed genital surgeries for minors in another video walsh posted a different doctor cautions that employees who don t want to treat transgender patients on the grounds of religious objections probably shouldn t work at vanderbilt at the end of the thread walsh wrote that the clinic s peer support group trans buddy program was in fact a gang of trans activists acting as surveillance in order to force compliance walsh tweeted later that evening that his report was just the beginning we are not going to let up he wrote we will shut this down the next day vanderbilt released a statement refuting walsh s claims vanderbilt university medical center is now the subject of social media posts and a video that misrepresent facts about the care the medical center provides to transgender patients the statement read vumc began its transgender health clinic because transgender individuals are a high risk population for mental and physical health issues and have been consistently underserved by the u s health system even when gender affirming medical care for minors was legal in tennessee the first step was still typically social transition such as a change in name pronouns dress or hairstyle once a child hit puberty their families might begin the long process of consulting with behavioral health specialists endocrinologists and primary care doctors about taking puberty blockers medication to temporarily pause the effects of puberty while weighing whether hormone replacement therapy might ease a child s gender dysphoria later in their teens over 30 major medical associations have deemed these standards of care medically necessary and lifesaving puberty blockers which stop the body from making sex hormones help slow unwanted secondary sex characteristics they do not as walsh suggested sterilize or castrate children though the medication could pose some risks to fertility if they are administered too early in puberty studies show the effects are largely reversible and the world professional association of transgender health recommends that providers talk with patients and their families about fertility preservation before starting medication in the years since vumc began providing gender affirming care for transgender youth and adults it grew into a holistic network of care not only involving health care providers but also spiritual care from a staff chaplain weekly support groups and insurance specialists according to a panel of vumc practitioners at an lgbtq health equity conference this fall vumc performed fewer than a dozen top surgeries or double mastectomies each year for transmasculine patients in their late teens according to riley such surgeries require patients to undergo months of therapy beforehand and a study published this summer showed that top surgery patients had little to no regrets decades after the operation both riley and a vumc executive c wright pinson said that the hospital never performed genital procedures on minors but walsh s claims caught the eye of republicans in tennessee which with its republican controlled legislature had become a paragon of a one party state hours after the tweets lee called for a thorough investigation into vumc and skrmetti vowed to use the full scope of his authority to ensure the medical center was complying with state law the investigation appears to have started as early as the following morning according to emails from republican state sen jack johson which huffpost obtained through a public records request the governor has already opened an investigation into vanderbilt and i will be filing legislation to prohibit this when we come back into session in january johnson wrote to one supporter on sept 21 the morning after walsh s tweets the governor s office told the associated press that day that it had passed along concerns about vumc to the attorney general lee s office recently told huffpost over email that the attorney general has the statutory authority to open an investigation the following day johnson responded to emails from supporters who were shocked by walsh s allegations reassuring them that he was on the case and had help i absolutely agree that these surgeries should not be allowed on children johnson wrote to one that is why i am working with matt walsh to introduce legislation in our upcoming legislative session to ban these transgender surgeries on children in tennessee skrmetti s office has said it began its probe in september 2022 after receiving a report about a vanderbilt doctor who publicly described her manipulation of medical billing codes to evade coverage limitations on gender related treatment which raised concerns about possible fraud in the state s medicaid plan tenncare the plan specifically excludes sex change or transformation surgery in august 2023 a reporter with nashville s news channel 5 interviewed skrmetti the segment showed portions of the video that skrmetti says instigated the report in it taylor discussed how she supports patients whose insurance plans don t cover transgender health care including saying she might write that a patient has a hormonal disorder for billing purposes so that she can order lab work for patients skrmetti in the interview said it was very easy to initiate the investigation because his office was already aware of the potential billing issues there he acknowledged that the probe into medical records is probably terrifying for patients but said there is no political exception to the fraud laws when reached for comment skrmetti s office referred huffpost to the interview with news channel 5 and did not respond to other questions for this story as the investigation went on skrmetti requested the private medical records of more than 150 vanderbilt patients who used tenncare john howser a vanderbilt spokesperson said the clinic was compelled to produce copies of the records while also complying with state and federal law including hipaa however many lgbtq and privacy advocates across the state and country signaled they were upset that vumc didn t fight harder to prevent turning over patient information in the investigation riley said they were flabbergasted to learn about the attorney general s inquiry into the center s billing process there s so many levels of oversight and protection from that kind of false billing they said it doesn t pass the test of reason providers don t do the billing there s a whole department of people that review the documentation and the code skrmetti s investigation and vanderbilt s release of records have been criticized as an egregious overstep and the latest and largest use of data requests by a state to undermine access to gender affirming care trust between patients and their doctors is essential to quality care and we regret any concern this may have caused for our patients howser said in a statement to huffpost in the past year as republican led states have increasingly passed anti trans legislation gop officials nationwide have leveraged data requests about transgender residents as one of their many tools to restrict access to medical care in missouri the attorney general requested and failed to obtain medical records on trans youth while in florida gov ron desantis probed state universities for data on how many students sought out gender affirming care on campus clinics more recently 19 republican attorneys general including skrmetti signed a letter pushing back against a federal rule that would shield states from requesting data on patients seeking abortion out of state many trans health advocates inside and outside the state said walsh s posts about vanderbilt not only seemed to provide pretext for the probe and ban on gender affirming care but that his inflammatory language and framing took the doctors words out of context and grossly mischaracterized the kinds of care that minors were receiving at the clinic the biggest thing i ve seen is just the sheer amount of terror of families of trans youth people are really terrified that the state is going to either try to take away their children from them or put them on some kind of watch list or try to invade their privacy there s just a lot of fear in tennessee right now with families lucas cameron vaughn a staff attorney at the aclu of tennessee told huffpost in july cameron vaughn is one of the attorneys representing the families of trans kids in the american civil liberties union s ongoing lawsuit against the state s ban on gender affirming care for transgender youth the ban was recently upheld by a federal appeals court ruling it may sound extreme to you when i say that we re living in a totalitarian state democratic state sen heidi campbell told huffpost before i became a state senator i don t think those words would have come out of my mouth but it s really just the truth there are no checks and balances in this government anymore we re seeing that with skrmetti who is hired by us to protect the people who live in this state and is actively attacking our own citizens on sept 21 2022 just one day after walsh s initial report about vumc he tweeted that he had met with johnson and republican state rep william lamberth to work on a bill to end gender affirming care for youth a few weeks later ahead of the state s midterm election on nov 8 lamberth penned an opinion piece promising he would partner with walsh to halt that care for minors if he were reelected to the house cameron vaughn wasn t surprised that walsh s posts lined up neatly ahead of the state s election it seems like this sort of campaign against vanderbilt was designed to scandalize vanderbilt university medical center s gender clinic by creating a deliberately false narrative right before the election he said lamberth and johnson both won their bids for reelection and filed identical bills to ban care for minors months before the start of the 2023 legislative session in february as the bill passed swiftly through committee meetings walsh attended a house meeting to give an expert testimony state rep john ray clemmons a democrat who represents nashville was one of few legislators to question walsh s expertise and knowledge of best practices for transgender youth during a committee meeting on health what qualifies me is that i am a human being with a brain and common sense and a soul and therefore i think it s a really bad idea to chemically castrate children walsh said during questioning you don t use your research to get clicks on your publication clemmons asked when the bill passed swiftly through each chamber of tennessee s government it was clear to clemmons that walsh was something new he was the gasoline reigniting an already burning fire in tennessee republicans had long been trying to pass various bans on gender affirming care but had been largely unsuccessful in 2021 tennessee succeeded in barring doctors from prescribing hormone therapy for prepubescent minors which in reality advocates say was not even happening in the state but this opened the door for lamberth and johnson to go further their legislation allows the state to ban puberty blockers hormone therapy and gender affirming surgeries for all transgender minors youth who are already receiving care will have to terminate it by march of next year and providers have already begun weaning adolescents off hormones walsh s voice had eclipsed the dozens of opponents to the bills including transgender youth and their parents lgbtq advocates and clinicians who showed up each week at the statehouse to share their stories about how access to gender affirming care was very often the buffer between life and death clemmons said he watched with horror as walsh and his media outlet the daily wire helped steer conversations among some of his colleagues obviously the attorney general in this state is taking marching orders from him which is embarrassing considering he s not even elected clemmons told huffpost referring to walsh this is a new brand of extremism that s very dangerous that openly admits to wanting to burn books on the house floor that openly admits to wanting to limit people s rights it s scary this is state sponsored intimidation and that s never played out well in history he added the attorney general s office declined to comment on its relationship with walsh lee the governor signed the ban into law at the beginning of march this kind of bill had been filed in previous years and did not pass because there were divisions among republicans on intervening in medical decisions but there was an almost complete lockstep unanimity that they were going to pass the bill in 2023 said chris sanders the executive director of the tennessee equality project so mr walsh is the first mover on this in a lot of ways in terms of getting a consensus built in the republican caucus he is not the first to think of it but he s partly responsible for jelling the consensus in tennessee since 2015 tennessee has enacted 19 anti lgbtq laws more than any other state in the country this all might not have been possible if walsh s workplace hadn t been given a royal welcome to the volunteer state the daily wire a one stop shop of conservative entertainment and merch including original documentaries tv shows children s programming and woke free razor blades has been likened to the right s answer to hollywood with a roster of conservative hosts including walsh candace owens and jordan peterson the company which was co founded by columnist ben shapiro relocated its headquarters from los angeles to nashville in 2020 the next year tennessee state lawmakers passed a resolution to embrace shapiro and his truth seekers and celebrate their move out of liberal california we congratulate ben shapiro and his associates at the daily wire on their relocation to tennessee and extend to them our best wishes for continued success in discovering and disseminating the truth the resolution stated campbell is highly critical of how her colleagues rolled out the welcome mat for the conservative company this is an attempted hostile takeover of nashville because they really want nashville to be their first right wing big city she said by the time walsh moved his family to nashville he was already practiced in exposing the ills of same sex marriage and laws that protected transgender americans rights to use the bathroom that aligns with their gender millions of americans have lost their grip on reality he wrote in a 2014 blog post arguing that trans people don t exist this is the real crisis and it s far more urgent than most of what they re talking about on the news right now in the past few years however walsh has turned toward a just asking questions style attack on trans people he built up mainstream notoriety and a career of lecturing at colleges after the release of his 2022 documentary what is a woman which also sows doubt about the existence of transgender people a self described theocratic fascist walsh has also argued that trans people are groomers and part of a cult and made posts mocking immigrants and black people and last august walsh responded after the right wing account libsoftiktok posted a barrage of false claims about the care boston children s hospital provides he called on his followers for an organized effort to fight back against the drugging and mutilating of children then the hospital which is the country s first pediatric transgender health program received two separate bomb threats walsh brushed off the threats as a leftist hoax tennessee republicans have echoed similar anti trans rhetoric at the end of 2022 the tennessee republican caucus sent out a survey asking constituents for their opinions about a number of issues including abortion and parental rights in schools in a section called protecting children the survey asks conservatives if they favor policies preventing minors from cutting off healthy body parts in order to change their gender identity there weren t any questions about guns or firearm reform in the survey even though the tennessee department of health found that the leading cause of death for children in the state was homicide 86 of which were due to gun violence late last october nashvillians had a glimpse of what walsh s version of the music city might look like when he held his rally to end child mutilation at the state capitol which garnered around 1 500 protesters including some proud boys there was walsh the bespectacled and bearded 37 year old standing on stage alongside johnson and lamberth as well as other conservative figures including sen marsha blackburn r tenn and former rep tulsi gabbard hawaii who announced that she was leaving the democratic party last year other right wing media stars including chloe cole an 18 year old detransitioner who has testified across the country in support of bans on transition care for minors also took the stage to speak we are all here today because of this information that matt brought forward and showed what was taking place just down the street right here in nashville and showing how the radical left is trying to put their woke agenda on every single family in this country blackburn told the crowd state sen janice bowling r was also present passing out fliers with what she called graphic photos of genital reconstruction surgeries some transgender people may choose to undergo after the event she wrote to johnson that many of the rally s attendees didn t know about the assaults these surgeries are on the bodies of these children according to emails obtained by huffpost two vanderbilt employees have confirmed to huffpost that the center never performed genital surgeries on children as is standard among clinicians of trans care upon looking at the photos their resolve to stay the course in our opposition was magnified bowling wrote a picture is truly worth a thousand words patients were shocked to find out that their personal medical information had been shared with the attorney general and some experienced emotional whiplash when they learned they might have been misinformed about their records being turned over one family of a trans teen who spoke to huffpost was first notified in june that vanderbilt had turned over the teen s records two months later the medical center told the family the teen s records weren t among those given to skrmetti by then the family which requested to remain anonymous due to concerns for their safety had already driven hundreds of miles to north carolina to make sure their child could continue hormone therapy we depend on our care providers to be honest with us the mother told huffpost they have precious lives in their hands i don t know whether to believe this or not in early september this year a spokesperson at vanderbilt confirmed that not all of the 150 records that were originally requested by skrmetti were shared with his office we have since confirmed that records for only 82 of these patients were provided to the attorney general s office said howser the spokesperson for vumc in an emailed statement to huffpost after learning of this we notified the remaining patients whose records were requested but not provided that their records have not been produced to the attorney general s office howser did not respond to further questions about why only 82 records were shared and whether the records of the remaining patients could be shared with the attorney general in the future riley said they can understand why vanderbilt did what it could to avoid unwanted attention but said such changes did a disservice to those who might look to the clinic as a resource because of people like matt walsh it forces that whole practice into the shadows which has a negative impact on patients in that now they may not know about the practice because there s no media presence about it riley said even with multiple statements rejecting walsh s claims it has been an uphill battle to dispel the factual errors about the clinic misinformation is like a snake riley said it just moves and shifts and you can say anything you want about facts and have all the patients that have had excellent outcomes but it doesn t make a bit of difference to the attorney general though the clinic can no longer provide gender affirming medical treatment for youth riley said they and their colleagues are more in it than ever before as they continue to service trans adults we re more supportive even if we re not able to do all the things we were able to before it kind of galvanizes a community of people to say this is wrong we re going to keep doing the right thing they said emphasizing that the care they provide complies within the bounds of the state s law clemmons believes that skrmetti is abusing his discovery powers that require no judicial oversight and the state s actions are ushering in a whole new day of invasion of privacy but he is hopeful that the time will come not too far down the line when the flames fan out the results of the national midterm elections showed that running on anti lgbtq rhetoric has been a losing battle for republicans still right wing media continues to influence voters in a way that has shifted their political ideology to further extremes and now politicians are trying to play catch up ari drennen the lgbtq program director at media matters who has spent much of her time tracking walsh s rise said walsh was able to capitalize on his boost in followers after the boston children s hospital incident and translate that into a similar push of vitriol in his home state i think part of the dynamic is that many republican politicians including in the presidential race are competing in a field of voters who ve been radicalized by personalities like matt walsh and who are expecting to hear the same rhetoric from politicians that they re hearing in podcasts and on youtube she said and so i would say that it s a case of politicians chasing walsh s audience more than the other way around for some tennesseans the only path forward is to leave roberto che espinoza a trans divinity scholar and baptist clergyperson left the state last month after learning his medical records had been shared with the attorney general espinoza who is in his 40s has not received an update about his records from vanderbilt espinoza lived in nashville for six years he was active in the local lgbtq community and often participated in social justice movements across the south including protesting against white supremacists at the unite the right rally in charlottesville virginia in 2017 when espinoza saw walsh s posts about vanderbilt he went on twitter to speak up about what he saw as a hateful distortion of christianity i was really vocal about the weaponization of religion and the dehumanization that the extreme right is peddling he told huffpost i just tried to do my part as both a christian minister and for my fellow trans comrades who are just trying to live their fucking lives after that espinoza said he started getting harassed on twitter nashville has fought hard to be a community that welcomes everyone and matt walsh has just come in and disregarded that by homogenizing the politics in the city he said the week before he was set to receive gender affirming surgery at vanderbilt espinoza said the proud boys targeted him on telegram his wife told him i don t know how much longer i have with you espinoza said he went from being active in nashville s queer religious community to feeling like a prisoner in his own home it was a very scary time and no way to live the release of his medical records this summer was the last straw espinoza crowdfunded 12 000 to leave the south he and his wife have been building a new community in the woods espinoza has been enjoying grilling outside and lifting weights and is grateful for the mundane moments of life i am sleeping at night and eating three meals a day he said i am able to leave my house without anxiety it s wonderful at certain times of day espinoza cannot help but feel those twitches of grief he never wanted to leave the south he misses the slow time he misses porch visits but he would rather be exiled in the north than feel the weight of fear and anxiety he shouldered not too long ago riley however is determined to remain in tennessee even as they worry that they and their colleagues will one day be pushed out of the state because of fear for their own personal and professional safety i think the right thing to do is to stay they said if we all leave then that s exactly what they want it just becomes one homogenous place

millions accusing israel of collective punishment of palestinians and the forced displacement of civilians philippe lazzarini warned that a further breakdown of civil order after the agency s warehouses were broken into by palestinians searching for food and other aid will make it extremely difficult if not impossible for the largest u n agency in gaza to continue operating briefings to the security council by lazzarini the head of the u n children s agency unicef and a senior u n humanitarian official painted a dire picture of the 23 days after hamas surprise oct 7 attacks in israel and its ongoing retaliatory military action aimed at obliterating the militant group which controls gaza according to the latest figures from 66 of them women and children and tens of thousands injured the u n humanitarian office said unicef executive director catherine russell that toll includes over 3 400 children killed and more than 6 300 injured this means that more than 420 children are being killed or injured in gaza each day a number which should shake each of us to our core she said lazzarini said this surpasses the number of children killed annually across the world s conflict zones since 2019 and he stressed this cannot be collateral damage many speakers at the council meeting denounced that killed over 1 400 people and urged the release of some 230 hostages taken to gaza by the militants but virtually every speaker also stressed that israel is obligated under international humanitarian law to protect civilians and their essentials for life including hospitals schools and other infrastructure and israel was criticized for cutting off food water fuel and medicine to gaza and cutting communications for several days lazzarini said the handful of through the rafah crossing from egypt in recent days is nothing compared to the needs of over 2 million people trapped in gaza the system in place to allow aid into gaza is geared to fail he said unless there is political will to make the flow of supplies meaningful matching the unprecedented humanitarian needs the commissioner general of the u n agency known as unrwa said there is no safe place anywhere in gaza warning that basic services are crumbling medicine food water and fuel are running out and the streets have started overflowing with sewage which will cause a massive health hazard very soon unicef oversees water and sanitation issues for the u n and russell warned that the lack of clean water and safe sanitation is on the verge of becoming a catastrophe u s ambassador linda thomas greenfield urged the divided security council which has rejected four resolutions that would have responded to the oct 7 hamas attacks and the ongoing war to come together saying the humanitarian crisis in gaza is growing more dire by the day stressing that all innocent civilians must be protected she said the council must call for the immediate and unconditional release of all hostages address the immense humanitarian needs of palestinian civilians in gaza affirm israel s right to defend itself from terrorism and remind all actors that international humanitarian law must be respected she reiterated president joe biden s calls for humanitarian pauses to get hostages out and allow aid in and for safe passage for civilians that means hamas must not use palestinians as human shields an act of unthinkable cruelty and a violation of the law of war the u s ambassador said and that means israel must take all possible precautions to avoid harm to civilians in a sign of increasing u s concern at the escalating palestinian death toll thomas greenfield told the council on sunday that while israel has the right and responsibility to defend its citizens from terrorism it must do so in a manner consistent with international humanitarian law the fact that hamas operates within and under the cover of civilians areas creates an added burden for israel but it does not lessen its responsibility to distinguish between terrorists and innocent civilians she stressed following the rejection of the four resolutions in the 15 member security council one vetoed by the u s one vetoed by russia and china and two for failing to get the minimum nine yes votes arab nations went to the u n general assembly last friday where there are no vetoes the 193 member world body

focused on recalling his grandfather who survived nazi death camps but whose his wife and seven children perished in the auschwitz gas chamber erdan told the council he will wear a yellow star just as hitler made his grandfather and other jews wear during world war ii until you condemn the atrocities of hamas and demand the immediate release of our hostages the ambassador then put a large six pointed yellow star of david saying never again on his suit jacket as did other israeli diplomats sitting behind him and said we walk with the yellow star as a symbol of pride a reminder that we swore

Sinai,World News,Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office played down the report.,Amy Teibel,2023-10-31 00:00:00,jerusalem ap an israeli government ministry has drafted a wartime proposal to transfer the gaza strip s 2 3 million people to egypt s sinai peninsula drawing condemnation from the palestinians and worsening tensions with cairo prime minister benjamin netanyahu s office played down the report compiled by the intelligence ministry as a hypothetical exercise a concept paper but its conclusions deepened long standing that israel wants to make gaza into egypt s problem and revived for palestinians memories of the uprooting of hundreds of thousands of people who fled or were forced from their homes during the fighting surrounding israel s creation in 1948 we are against transfer to any place in any form and we consider it a red line that we will not allow to be crossed nabil abu rudeineh spokesman for palestinian president mahmoud abbas said of the report what happened in 1948 will not be allowed to happen again a mass displacement abu rudeineh said would be tantamount to declaring a new war the proposal comes as netanyahu reportedly lobbied european union nations last week to pressure egypt to take in gazan refugees but was rebuffed so far more than 8 000 palestinians the vast majority of them civilians have been killed since israel went to war against hamas after its oct 7 attack the document is dated oct 13 six days after hamas militants killed more than 1 400 people in southern israel and took over 240 hostage in an attack that provoked a devastating israeli war in gaza it was first published by sicha mekomit a local news site in its report the intelligence ministry a junior ministry that conducts research but does not set policy offered three alternatives to effect a significant change in the civilian reality in the gaza strip in light of the hamas crimes that led to the sword of iron war the document s authors deem this alternative to be the most desirable for israel s security the document proposes moving gaza s civilian population to tent cities in northern sinai then building permanent cities and an undefined humanitarian corridor a security zone would be established inside israel to block the displaced palestinians from entering the report did not say what would become of gaza once its population is cleared out egypt s foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the report but egypt has made clear throughout this latest war that it does not want to take in a wave of palestinian refugees egypt has long feared that israel wants to force a permanent expulsion of palestinians into its territory as happened during the war surrounding israel s independence egypt ruled gaza between 1948 and 1967 when israel captured the territory along with the west bank and east jerusalem the vast majority of gaza s population are the descendants of palestinian refugees uprooted from what is now israel egypt s president abdel fattah el sissi has said a mass influx of refugees from gaza would eliminate the palestinian nationalist cause it would also risk bringing militants into sinai where they might launch attacks on israel he said that would endanger the countries 1979 peace treaty he proposed that israel instead house palestinians in its negev desert which neighbors the gaza strip until it ends its military operations yoel guzansky a senior fellow at the institute for national security studies in tel aviv said the paper threatened to damage relations with a key partner if this paper is true this is a grave mistake it might cause a strategic rift between israel and egypt said guzansky who said he has consulted for the ministry in the past i see it either as ignorance or someone who wants to negatively affect israel egypt relations which are very important at this stage egypt is a valuable partner that cooperates behind the scenes with israel he said if it is seen as overtly assisting an israeli plan like this especially involving the palestinians it could be devastating to its stability egypt would not necessarily be the palestinian refugees last stop the document speaks about egypt turkey qatar saudi arabia and the united arab emirates supporting the plan either financially or by taking in uprooted residents of gaza as refugees and in the long term as citizens canada s lenient immigration practices also make it a potential resettlement target the document adds at first glance this proposal is liable to be complicated in terms of international legitimacy the document acknowledges in our assessment fighting after the population is evacuated would lead to fewer civilian casualties compared to what could be expected if the population were to remain an israeli official familiar with the document said it isn t binding and that there was no substantive discussion of it with security officials netanyahu s office called it a concept paper the likes of which are prepared at all levels of the government and its security agencies the issue of the day after has not been discussed in any official forum in israel which is focused at this time on destroying the governing and military capabilities of hamas the prime minister s office said the document dismisses the two other options reinstating the west bank based palestinian authority as the sovereign in gaza or supporting a local regime among other reasons it rejects them as unable to deter attacks on israel the reinstatement of the palestinian authority which was ejected from gaza after a weeklong 2007 war that put hamas in power would be an unprecedented victory of the palestinian national movement a victory that will claim the lives of thousands of israeli civilians and soldiers and does not safeguard israel s security the document says

hundred thousand palestinians remain in northern gaza in the path of the ground assault they have crowded into homes or are packed by the thousands into hospitals that are already overwhelmed with patients and running low on supplies in the jabaliya refugee camp a densely built up area of small streets on gaza city s outskirts dozens of rescuers searched for survivors amid a series of obliterated buildings and others that had partially collapsed young men carried the limp forms of two children from the upper floors of the crumbling frame of one damaged apartment building while helping down another child and woman it was unclear whether the children were alive or dead gray dust apparently left by pulverized concrete seemed to coat nearly everything the israeli military said it carried out a wide scale strike in jabaliya on hamas infrastructure that had taken over civilian buildings brig gen daniel hagari said an underground hamas installation beneath a targeted building collapsed toppling other nearby buildings conricus later said the main strike had hit between buildings we don t intend for the ground to collapse he told reporters but the issue is that hamas built their tunnels there and that they re running their operations from there he said the commander killed in the strike ibrahim biari played an important role in the oct 7 attack and had been involved in anti israeli attacks going back decades also on tuesday the israeli military said ground troops took control of a hamas military stronghold in west jabaliya killing 50 militants hamas spokesman hazem qassem denied the military s claim saying it was trying to justify its heinous crime against civilians hagari repeated calls for civilians to evacuate northern gaza to the south the military says it targets hamas fighters and infrastructure and that the militants endanger civilians by operating among them the military has also repeatedly emphasized it will strike hamas wherever it finds it some 800 000 palestinians have reportedly fled to the south but many have not in part because they say nowhere is safe as israeli airstrikes in the south have continued to cause civilian deaths the window to flee may be closing as israeli forces reached gaza s main north south highway this week more than 8 500 palestinians have been killed in the war mostly women and minors said tuesday without providing a breakdown between civilians and fighters is without precedent in decades of israeli palestinian violence over 1 400 people have died on the israeli side mainly civilians killed during

targets in syria linked to iran which supports hamas hezbollah and other armed groups in the region some 200 000 people have been evacuated from israeli towns near gaza and the northern border with lebanon the military said it shot down what appeared to be a drone near the southernmost city of eilat and intercepted a missile over the red sea on tuesday neither of which entered israeli airspace iranian backed houthi rebels in yemen later claimed they fired ballistic missiles and drones at israel saying it was their third such operation and threatening more earlier this month a u s navy destroyer in the red sea launched toward israel by the houthis who control much of northern yemen in the occupied west bank the army demolished the family home of saleh al arouri a senior hamas official exiled over a decade ago an official in the village of aroura said the home had been vacant for 15 years israeli forces reportedly have advanced north and east of gaza city south of the city israeli troops were also trying to cut off the territory s main highway and the parallel road along the mediterranean coast according to dawood shehab a spokesperson for islamic jihad a smaller militant group allied with hamas zaki abdel hay a palestinian living a few minutes walk from the road south of gaza city said people are afraid to use it people are very scared the israeli tanks are still close he said over the phone adding that constant artillery fire could be heard near the road the israeli military said it struck some 300 militant targets over the past day including compounds inside tunnels and that troops had engaged in several battles with militants armed with antitank missiles and machine guns gaza s humanitarian crisis continued to worsen the world health organization said two hospitals were damaged and an ambulance destroyed in gaza over the last two days it said all 13 hospitals operating in the north have received israeli evacuation orders in recent days medics have refused such orders saying it would be a death sentence for patients on life support gaza city s shifa hospital the largest in the territory is on the verge of running out of fuel the health ministry said there has been no central electricity in gaza for weeks and israel has barred the entry of fuel needed to power generators for hospitals and homes saying it wants to prevent it from falling into hamas hands it has allowed a limited amount of food water medicine and other supplies to enter from egypt though far less than what is needed relief groups say a convoy of 59 aid trucks entered through the rafah crossing with egypt on tuesday the largest yet bringing the total that have entered since oct 22 to 216 according to wael abu omar hamas spokesperson for the crossing the u n

Date,2023-10-30 00:00:00,washington made clear to his followers he knows the difference between a jail and a prison and he may well get a chance to experience both thanks to the same federal judge soon after u s district judge tanya chutkan on sunday night reinstated a limited gag order banning trump from attacking likely witnesses in the criminal case related to his coup attempt the former president unloaded on his onetime attorney general bill barr who is almost certain to be called as a prosecution witness i called bill barr dumb weak slow moving lethargic gutless and lazy a rino who couldn t do the job trump to social media about an hour after chutkan s decision was entered into the court record bill barr is a loser it s unknown whether chutkan will respond to the apparent offense by revoking trump s pretrial release and sending him to the district of columbia lockup in any event trump will be at her mercy should he be convicted of the most serious felonies in the case she is overseeing which are punishable by decades in prison trump s lawyers and campaign staff did not respond to huffpost queries about the attack on barr after chutkan s gag order was back in place who spent two decades prosecuting felonies in the district of columbia s u s attorney s office said chutkan would likely have to determine whether trump was aware that her order which she had temporarily put on hold had been reinstated though if and when he flouts it again trump in the wee hours monday chutkan for lifting the stay calling her a very biased trump hating judge chutkan would clearly have the factual basis for establishing that trump knew what he was doing kirschner said it s within her discretion he said but added that she had previously denied prosecutors request to spell out that noncompliance with a gag order would violate his conditions of release others said that while chutkan could in theory order that trump be locked up ahead of trial such a move would likely be seen as too drastic going from zero to 60 on punishment would be unwise said renato mariotti another former federal prosecutor who cautioned that appeals courts would take trump s argument that he has a first amendment right to publicly disparage anyone he wants including witnesses he suggested that a more effective tool chutkan could use is to advance trump s trial date from next spring trump and his lawyers have been working hard to push all of his criminal trials until after the november 2024 election should trump win the presidency back he would be able to end federal prosecutions against him and almost certainly have the state cases put on hold until his term ended throwing this guy in jail would create more problems mariotti said trump who throughout his political life has displayed a surprising level of ignorance about basic facts regarding the nation and the world brought up the prison jail distinction at his saturday night rally at a country music nightclub near the las vegas airport you know there s a difference between a prison and a jail trump asked his audience apropos of very little not a big difference neither one s great jails are typically for pretrial detainees who are being held as dangers to the community and for those serving sentences of less than a year prisons are generally for those who have been sentenced to a year or more of incarceration after a criminal conviction it s not clear whether trump has known this for some time or if he only learned of the difference since his own encounters with the criminal justice system began earlier this year trump has been claiming that he didn t even know what an indictment was until prosecutors started indicting him this spring chutkan on oct 16 found that trump s previous statements disparaging witnesses prosecutors and the judicial system both put people in personal danger and made it more difficult to ensure a fair trial chutkan herself now has as a result of trump s repeated verbal and written attacks against her she prohibited the former president from targeting prosecutors court personnel although she did not include herself in that category and witnesses who would be testifying at his trial in her new filing reinstating that gag order she wrote that trump was perfectly capable of continuing his campaign for president within her guidelines and used his own social media posts as proof on oct 20 while her initial order was in effect trump lashed out at president joe biden repeated his lies that the 2020 election had been stolen from and claimed that the prosecutions against him were designed to keep him from returning to office all comments that chutkan had already said were allowable under her gag order but on oct 24 during the period that the order was suspended trump attacked his former chief of staff mark meadows and the credibility of his likely testimony this statement would almost certainly violate the order under any reasonable definition of targeting chutkan wrote the plain distinctions between this statement and the prior one apparent to the court and both parties demonstrate that far from being arbitrary or standardless the order s prohibition on targeting statements can be straightforwardly understood and applied in addition to the four count indictment he faces in chutkan s federal courtroom trump is under 87 separate counts in three other indictments in georgia state court new york state court and a federal court in south florida he nevertheless remains the polling leader in the race for the 2024 republican presidential nomination

ago he tried and failed to acquire a device used to quiet gunshots according to a gun shop owner in auburn rick lachapelle owner of coastal defense firearms said card purchased a suppressor also called a silencer online and arranged to pick it up at his shop card already had submitted information to the federal government to purchase it and federal authorities had approved the sale to that point he said on aug 5 when card filled out the form at lachapelle s gun shop to pick up the silencer he answered yes to the question have you ever been adjudicated as a mental defective or have you ever been committed to a mental institution as soon as he answered that yes we know automatically that this is disqualifying he s not getting a silencer today lachapelle said silencers are more heavily regulated under federal law than most firearms federal law requires buyers to apply with the bureau of alcohol tobacco firearms and explosives and be approved the typical wait time is between six and eight months said mark collins federal policy director at the gun violence prevention group brady after the atf approves the application the silencer is sent to a licensed firearm dealer where the buyer is required to fill out another form required for any firearm purchase the dealer then has to run a background check that form asks questions similar to the paperwork required to buy a gun

medication abortions on hold and blocked the state from enforcing older abortion restrictions.,JOHN HANNA,2023-10-30 00:00:00,topeka kan ap a judge on monday put a new state law on medication on hold and blocked older restrictions that for years have spelled out what providers must tell patients and forced patients to wait 24 hours to end their pregnancies the ruling was another big victory for abortion rights advocates in kansas where a decisively confirmed protections for abortion access under the state constitution district judge k christopher jayaram s order suspends some restrictions that have been in effect for years the waiting period had been in place since 1997 the court has great respect for the deeply held beliefs on either side of this contentious issue jayaram wrote in his 92 page order nevertheless the state s capacity to legislate pursuant to its own moral scruples is necessarily curbed by the kansas constitution and its bill of rights jayaram s order is set to remain in effect through the trial set for the end of june 2024 for a lawsuit against state officials who would enforce abortion restrictions the providers filed their case in johnson county in the kansas city area home to two clinics that provide abortions the legal battle highlights the importance of state courts in attempts to preserve access a little more than a year after the u s supreme court s ended protections under the u s constitution and allowed states to ban abortion in august ruled that the state s ban was too restrictive and heard arguments on whether it should lift a hold on a state law there banning most abortions kansas has been an outlier on abortion among states with republican controlled legislatures the state supreme court that the kansas constitution protects a right to bodily autonomy and therefore access to abortion as a fundamental right gop lawmakers proposed an amendment to the state constitution to declare that it doesn t grant a right to abortion and in the august 2022 vote that ballot initiative lost by a wide margin upholding abortion rights republican lawmakers nevertheless argued this year that reasonable restrictions are still fair game required abortion providers to tell their patients that a medication abortion can be stopped using a regimen touted by anti abortion groups the state until another ruling from jayaram in an august hearing jayaram said his reading of medical literature showed that the regimen s effectiveness is not confirmed by any valid studies major medical groups consider the regimen ineffective and potentially unsafe providers also attacked existing laws enacted by gop lawmakers as a way to ensure patients are properly informed before undergoing an abortion patients not only must receive medical information 24 hours before the procedure but that information must also be in writing and in a specific size and style of type it must include statements drafted by abortion opponents about fetal development and purported abortion risks that major medical groups consider debunked false or misleading i m struggling to see why we re singling out one specific provider type and one specific service jayaram told the state s attorneys from the bench during the recent hearing attorneys for the providers have argued that the growing layers of restrictions created a biased counseling scheme designed to discourage abortion kansas doesn t ban most abortions until the 22nd week of pregnancy the providers also said challenging older restrictions became more compelling as other states banned abortion and out of state residents flooded them with requests for appointments kansas saw a 57 increase in abortions in 2022 according to state health department data we feel compelled to get patients who are going to get back in the car for 15 hours medically accurate information because we know they re scared to talk to providers at home emily wales ceo of great plains told reporters after a recent court hearing abortion opponents argued repeatedly before the august 2022 vote that without a change in the state constitution all existing abortion restrictions could be at risk the state supreme court is reviewing a 2015 law banning the most common second trimester procedure and a 2011 law imposing tougher health and safety requirements only for abortion providers neither has been enforced because of the litigation attorneys for the state and the anti abortion alliance for defending freedom argue that in suing the state this year providers are working against their patients interest in having as

even loyal most of us were like holy cow said beverly cuyler a long time boebert supporter and one of the big reasons for that is a gap between how she presented herself as a christian and what ended up happening expected to face with democrat adam frisch in a race that could determine which party controls congress boebert tackled the embarrassment head on at the lincoln day dinner in archuleta county i owe each and every one of you here a deep heartfelt apology she said as murmurs of agreement faded to attentive silence it s an unusual tone for boebert the congresswoman s unapologetic trumpian style had propelled her to maga stardom nationwide now she s fighting for political survival at home boebert who defended former president s claims of fraud in the 2020 presidential election and stood in the vanguard of his make america great again movement appears clear eyed about the challenge ahead she s offered olive branches to local newspapers she once spurned as biased so called which she s decried as an underhanded democratic tactic will be part of her campaign strategy her supporters can attend boot camps to become versed in her talking points which have partly shifted from national priorities to more local matters a strategy endorsed by the state gop her misstep in 2022 was not being as focused on the district so she s making adjustments to not make that mistake again said dave williams chairman of the colorado frisch has raised at least 7 7 million the third largest house campaign chest nationwide to boebert s 2 4 million he s asking voters to help him stop the circus reviving a slogan from the 2022 election democrats certainly smell blood in the water boebert said in an interview sitting in a long hall in southwest colorado before the lincoln day dinner boebert said she s always focused on district issues in past campaigns but added that this time around they are pushing more aggressive messaging on the ground emphasizing legislation she s helped push through congress that directly impacts southwest colorado certainly when you had the closest congressional race in the entire country you know it s a big deal her new campaign manager drew sexton said in an interview there was a need to kind of beef up on staff after you know the last cycle and you know kind of wanted to have a different approach it s a balancing act boebert has cultivated a national profile as larger than colorado a far right agitator who ascends to the stage of conservative conferences to geysers of sparks in speeches across the country she s blurred the line between political rally and religious revival but she also has a job as a policymaker where she s focused on nuts and bolts issues that matter to her constituents forest management water rights jobs and public lands for many supporters the two roles overlap her district s vast expanse includes ruddy red mesas standing sentry over ranches owned for generations coal mining hamlets in the rocky mountains and a streak of frontier libertarianism among its residents where god and big government are both feared voters take deep pride in their way of life and many feel it s being forgotten and demeaned boebert s full throated defense of agrarian conservative christian values helps explain how she got to congress in the first place our voices get drowned out by bigger cities said cody perkins 31 who arrived at the lincoln day dinner bedecked in an american flag suit i just like that she s not afraid to speak up we need a voice those values are the same reason perkins cringed when the videotape surfaced of boebert at the theater in denver boebert s apology perkins said was definitely needed i hope we can all move past this he said for other republicans boebert s provocations are disheartening it should be a lot easier to get a republican candidate into the district we shouldn t be pulling teeth to get votes said dusty mars 44 who voted for boebert in the past but isn t sure what he ll do in the primary mars will vote for the republican candidate in the general election he said but hopes for one that will represent our values in a way that doesn t offend other people dennis anderson who publishes several newspapers in the district said boebert appears to be returning to her 2019 roots as a scrappy electrifying candidate fighting for the people while campaigning in the district this election boebert seems more empathetic than her disruptive national profile lately it feels like she s been knocked back down to earth a little bit he said at events and debates in the last election boebert railed against then speaker nancy pelosi who became a foil for bloated government a broken system and democratic demagoguery she was very focused on being a foot soldier for donald trump being kind of a thorn in the side for the biden administration said seth masket director of the center on american politics in colorado boebert s updated campaign strategy not all that far removed from pelosi s election adage of owning the ground seemed a smart way to pivot said masket who expects boebert to do better in the 2024 election anyway he thinks trump s presidential campaign will draw more republicans to the polls pelosi s dethronement which boebert said freed her up to push for laws that help her constituents also raises fresh questions about boebert s effectiveness as a lawmaker in trainings where supporters learn her messaging the aperture has shrunk to local policy and legislative changes boebert fought during the first speakership battle leaving efforts to impeach president joe biden out of the frame boebert s demands during mccarthy s weeks trying to get elected speaker included 72 hours to read a bill before a vote an issue that attendees at the lincoln day dinner in colorado enthusiastically applauded still after her narrow victory last time boebert will have to win back some unaffiliated voters and moderate conservatives who defected to frisch last time boebert says she is intent on sending a message that i can work with my colleagues on the other side of the aisle and not compromise my principles while everyone is familiar with the congresswoman s stance on hot button national issues boebert and her campaign are emphasizing her work on lesser known policies including her bipartisan efforts to retain jobs as a chemical depot shutters in her district after colorado s largely city dwellers voted to reintroduce wolves to colorado boebert has also proposed legislation to give ranchers greater recourse to defend their flocks that legislation received raucous applause at the archuleta county event from the voters seated around folding tables but when boebert turned her attention to the scandal a hush came over the room i let you down i fell short of my standards and i m taking full accountability of what you ve seen and what you ve heard said boebert and i will never put myself in a position to dishonor you some

and videos provide disturbing details on the unlikely new face of the Second Amendment.,Roque Planas,2023-10-30 00:00:00,on july 25 tarrant county district court received a letter from zackey rahimi he wanted to apologize the man at the center of a monumental supreme court case on gun rights allegedly shot guns in public at least six times over a three month period three times directly at people once into a house and twice into the air all of those alleged shootings occurred while he was under a protective order for domestic violence that prohibited him from possessing firearms in the letter rahimi pleaded with the judge to take mercy on him since his family immigrated to the united states from afghanistan he had grown up in poverty he wrote shy and overweight kids at school bullied him a devoted gearhead he found a way to help his family pay the bills in high school by flipping cars bought at auction after repairing and detailing them at some point however he drifted toward the wrong crowd that was using me trying to get me to go on a wrong path i started being intoxicated at all times by smoking marijuana drinking alcohol doing pills all type of mess trying to get me to become a whole other person rahimi wrote now he wanted to put the drugs behind him and focus on trying to earn an engineering certificate from a technical school in the hope of landing a job in the automobile industry to help support his parents and his young son he promised the judge he would stay away from firearms weapons never to be away from my family again rahimi s disavowal of firearms is an ironic twist for the man whose case may end up expanding gun rights after it is heard at the supreme court on nov 7 it s the federal case for possession of firearms while under a protective order a felony since 1994 that turned rahimi into the unlikely face of a gun rights movement he now wants little to do with the supreme court promises to settle the question of whether the constitution allows authorities to strip a domestic abuser s gun rights on the basis of a civil order the court s ruling will have repercussions far beyond rahimi himself a decision against him would mark the first time the conservative dominated court sets limits on the sweeping reinterpretation of second amendment rights laid out by justice clarence thomas last year a ruling in rahimi s favor on the other hand would send shockwaves through the gun reform movement with thomas new standard passed in the name of public safety gun rights groups have kept the case and its potentially unsympathetic defendant at arm s length but several of them have filed briefs arguing that the supreme court rahimi s second amendment rights questioning why the state of texas did not charge him criminally for several alleged acts of violence described in federal court records before he allegedly went on a shooting spree documents and videos obtained by huffpost from both state and federal courts including the letter to the judge shed new light on the events that eventually thrust rahimi into the national spotlight allowing the most complete reconstruction to date of his alleged misdeeds and self professed remorse rahimi 23 faces a total of 11 criminal charges in texas most of which have not been previously reported the videos which have not been publicly revealed before show a man prosecutors say is rahimi firing guns recklessly in public including one incident that shows two small children were only feet away from the volley of bullets in a landmark case last year the conservative supreme court laid out a sweeping new vision for second amendment protections judges should no longer consider the government s interest in public safety when weighing the constitutionality of gun restrictions thomas wrote in the majority opinion for new york state rifle pistol association inc v bruen instead gun restrictions are only constitutional if similar laws existed at some point roughly between 1791 when the bill of rights became law and the end of the civil war that decision over the constitutionality of dozens of long standing gun restrictions as judges struggled to interpret what many legal scholars view as an unusually vague and improbably expansive ruling rahimi s case was among the most controversial gun reformers and advocates for victims of domestic violence were appalled that the three judge panel would over a woman seeking protection or over public safety in general rahimi faces a total of five felonies and six misdemeanors most of them involving guns contrary to second amendment defenders assertions in amicus briefings to the supreme court the state of texas did charge rahimi in criminal court for the string of abusive acts that resulted in his protective order the events began on dec 9 2019 when rahimi and his former girlfriend who is the mother of their young son got into an argument in a parking lot in arlington texas according to federal and state court records as she tried to leave rahimi allegedly threw her to the ground then dragged her by the hair toward a car and shoved her inside bashing her forehead on the dash in the process when a bystander tried to intervene rahimi opened fire at them on feb 5 a tarrant county court issued a protective order barring rahimi from contacting his former partner or their young son for two years due to rahimi s acts of family violence the court informed him that possessing a firearm while under the protective order was a federal felony punishable by up to 10 years in prison the next month prosecutors in tarrant county charged rahimi with three offenses terroristic threat of family household assault causing bodily injury and recklessly discharging a firearm all three offenses are class a misdemeanors in texas the most serious non felony offense level police arrested rahimi on march 9 2020 a magistrate set a 2 500 bond for each of the three offenses which rahimi posted using a bail bondsman the terms of the bonds also forbade him from possessing firearms or contacting his ex despite his mounting legal troubles rahimi allegedly approached his ex girlfriend s house in violation of the protective order two months later on may 10 according to state criminal records federal prosecutors later wrote in a brief to the supreme court that rahimi also violated the protective order by attempting to communicate with his ex on social media when police found rahimi and arrested him three months later they allegedly discovered fentanyl on him yet another violation of the terms of his growing number of bonds this time a tarrant county magistrate recommended a bond of only 1 500 for violating the protective order and released him for half of that his bond for fentanyl possession was set for 1 500 again the county released him shortly after that rahimi went on a string of at least six shootings over three months on nov 12 2020 rahimi asked a 25 year old woman over snapchat to meet him in a parking lot saying he had something for her when she arrived she told police she saw rahimi kneeling by the driver s side of a car wearing all black clothes including a black ski mask over his face rahimi appeared to carry a pistol with an extended magazine larger than the gun itself as she drove away rahimi allegedly fired a handful of times with some of the bullets appearing to strike her car while she was inside it s a pattern that would repeat itself in two separate instances rahimi allegedly fired at other drivers in acts of apparent road rage rahimi also fired into a person s home the same month according to a grand jury indictment federal prosecutors would later tell the supreme court he fired an ar 15 into the house of someone who had bought drugs from him over comments the customer made on social media and in january 2021 rahimi fired into the air outside a whataburger after his friend s credit card was declined federal court records say fort worth police arrested rahimi on jan 14 2021 according to state court records when police from arlington where rahimi was also wanted searched his family home they found a 45 caliber glock with an extended magazine lying on his bedroom nightstand a 308 caliber semi automatic rifle under the bed and a copy of the protective order prohibiting him from possessing either gun the detectives referred the case to agents with the bureau of alcohol tobacco firearms and explosives who filed a criminal complaint in federal court the same day against rahimi for possessing firearms while under a protective order for domestic violence rahimi s violent tendencies appeared to continue after his incarceration on march 28 2021 a police officer reprimanded rahimi repeatedly for reaching out his hands to pass items to other inmates while walking past their units the last time the officer ordered rahimi to place his hands on the bars when rahimi refused the officer tried to physically guide him away rahimi struck the officer in the throat with his left hand but a few months later as his sentencing drew near rahimi appeared to change his public defenders raised constitutional objections to the law from the beginning which is common but the issue had already been argued and decided in texas so rahimi had little choice but to plead guilty the case stayed alive however because his public defenders and the u s attorney s office remained at odds over the length of his sentence and whether he should serve it after or alongside whatever jail time he might end up serving for his state offenses you re talking about six separate shootings here assistant u s attorney frank gatto told judge mark pittman on sept 23 2021 as he weighed rahimi s sentence and to me that first video where he causes this accident gets out and just starts shooting is one of the most bone chilling videos for me to watch and see if that doesn t send chills down anybody s spine seeing that i don t know of much else that can to just come out and cause this accident pull out your gun and just start emptying your clip into that other person s car to me i think that truly shows there is a grave and callous disregard of human life gatto added rahimi had yet to be convicted of anything else other than a marijuana possession misdemeanor from three years before for which he had only served six days assistant federal public defender rachel taft responded he had a right to let the state cases play out before the court used the allegations against him to raise his sentence he planned to seek anger management and educational opportunities while incarcerated she said even with a five year sentence if mr rahimi were to be released in his mid 20s at that time we would see full formation of his frontal cortex and we would see certainly just by nature of maturity level a different person when he is released taft told the judge he s talked to me about some of the inmates he s met there who don t know their children their parents have passed away and they weren t able to be there and he doesn t want that for himself pittman then asked to hear from rahimi the defendant said he realized his pre sentencing report said terrible things but that is truly not me i am a very good human being but it s my mistake for being around those wrong people and not listening to my family rahimi told the judge i m a new man having faith and seeking only the straight pathway and staying very close to the lord his plea failed to convince the judge noting that rahimi had a criminal history dating back to age 11 his six alleged shootings his history of domestic violence and his disregard for the protective order pittman sentenced rahimi to 73 months in prison the sentence would run concurrently to most of his misdemeanors but consecutively to whatever sentence he received in the case of the aggravated assault in which he allegedly lured the woman into the parking lot rahimi s lawyers appealed the sentencing decision which put the case before the 5th u s circuit court of appeals after the supreme court s bombshell ruling in bruen when a three judge panel reviewed the case early this year they overturned rahimi s conviction altogether theoretically restoring his gun rights rahimi is still locked up in green bay jail in fort worth he faces the looming possibility of sentences in his three aggravated assault cases that could range anywhere from two to 20 years all this makes him an unusual candidate for determining the future of gun rights the supreme court has issued three major rulings that taken together have massively expanded the second amendment since 2008 law abiding citizens seeking to use firearms for self protection filed the first two while a firearms advocacy group filed the third all three coursed their way through civil rather than criminal court rahimi on the other hand only wants his freedom back and now swears off guns as he tries to get it i had firearms for the right reason in our place to be able to protect my family at all times especially for what we ve went through in the past rahimi wrote in his letter of apology to the tarrant county court but i ll make sure to do whatever it takes to be able to do everything the right pathway

hearing on one lawsuit to bar trump from the ballot in begins monday while on thursday oral arguments are scheduled before the on an effort to kick the republican former president off the ballot in that state whether the judges keep trump on the ballot or boot him their rulings are likely to be swiftly appealed eventually to the u s supreme court the nation s highest court has never ruled on the civil war era provision in the 14th amendment that prohibits those who swore an oath to uphold the constitution and then engaged in insurrection against it from holding higher office we ve had hearings with presidential candidates debating their eligibility before ted cruz john mccain said derek t muller a notre dame law professor listing candidates challenged on whether they met the constitutional requirement of being a natural born citizen but these cases muller added are different using an obscure clause of the constitution with the incendiary bar against insurrection even if they re long shots muller said they have a plausible legal path to success and raise important issues those legal questions are very heavy ones muller said dozens of cases citing section three of the 14th amendment have been filed in recent months but the ones in colorado and minnesota seem the most important according to legal experts that s because they were filed by two liberal groups with significant legal resources they also targeted states with a clear swift process for challenges to candidates ballot qualifications that means the colorado and minnesota cases are taking a more legally sound route to get courts to force election officials to disqualify trump as opposed to other lawsuits that seek a sweeping ruling from federal judges that trump is no longer eligible for the presidency the plaintiffs in the cases argue the issue is simple trump s efforts to overturn his 2020 election loss leading to the mean he s disqualified from the presidency just as clearly as if he were not a natural born citizen another constitutional prerequisite for the office four years after taking an oath to preserve protect and defend the constitution as president of the united states trump tried to overthrow the results of the 2020 election leading to a violent insurrection at the united states capitol to stop the lawful transfer of power to his successor alleges the colorado lawsuit filed on behalf of republican and unaffiliated voters by the liberal group citizens for responsibility and ethics in washington by instigating this unprecedented assault on the american constitutional order trump violated his oath and disqualified himself under the fourteenth amendment from holding public office including the office of the president trump has castigated the lawsuits as election interference his lawyers contend that none of the issues are simple in a provision of the constitution that hasn t been used in 150 years the clause has only been used a handful of times since immediately after the civil war trump s lawyers contend that it was never meant to apply to the office of president which is not mentioned in the text unlike senator or representative in congress and elector of president and vice president the provision allows congress to grant amnesty as was done in 1872 to allow former confederates back into government which has led some to argue that it has no power without an enabling act of congress finally trump s lawyers contend the former president never engaged in insurrection and was simply exercising his free speech rights to warn about he did not believe were legitimate trump s comments did not come close to incitement let alone engagement in an insurrection his attorneys wrote in a filing in the colorado case adding examples of cases where the congressional authors of section three declined to use it against people who only rhetorically backed the confederacy the arguments in colorado could feature testimony from witnesses to the jan 6 attack or other important events during to overturn the election the identities of witnesses have been shielded until they take the stand part of the court s the heated rhetoric and threats that have become an issue in trump s criminal trials the lawyers are expected to delve deeply into the history of the drafting of the provision in the 14th amendment and its use between its adoption in 1868 and the amnesty law in 1872 there is scant legal precedent on the issue so little that the attorneys have had to argue about the meaning of an 1869 case written by salmon chase who was then chief justice of the u s supreme court but wrote only as an appeals judge after the amnesty act in 1872 legal scholars could only find one other time the provision was cited when congress

Their Families Are Less Certain.,World News,Annihilating Hamas would seem to require a ground operation of unprecedented intensity fraught with the risk of harming Israeli hostages.,Julia Frankel,2023-10-29 00:00:00,jerusalem ap the israeli military has sought to assure the public it can achieve the two goals of its war on hamas simultaneously toppling the strip s militant rulers and rescuing some 230 hostages abducted from israel but as the army ramps up airstrikes and ground incursions on the blockaded enclave laying waste to entire neighborhoods in preparation for a broader invasion the anguished families of hostages are growing increasingly worried those aims will collide with devastating consequences annihilating hamas would seem to require a ground operation of unprecedented intensity fraught with the risk of harming israeli hostages saving hostages stuck inside gaza would appear to require engagement with hamas the group that forever traumatized the country when it sent fighters into southern israel to brutally kill sparking this latest war between the bitter enemies over 7 700 palestinians have been killed in the israeli offensive according to the israel s government has not described what a rescue mission could look like in a televised address late saturday prime minister benjamin netanyahu acknowledged the agony of hostages families and promised their release was an integral part of israel s war effort on par with its goal of destroying hamas hamas political leaders are in negotiations with mediators egypt and qatar to secure the freedom of at least some trapped israeli civilians four hostages so far anxiety over hamas hostages reached a fever pitch saturday as israel intensified its air campaign and sent troops into gaza with heavy firepower crowds protested outside israel s defense ministry in tel aviv demanding that netanyahu and other officials address the fate of their loved ones it worked netanyahu met with the families saturday and vowed to exercise and exhaust every possibility to bring them home defense minister yoav gallant promised to meet them sunday for what his office described as the first official meeting with them we are not waiting any longer said protester malki shem tov whose 21 year old son omer is being held captive in gaza we want all of them back with us today we want you the cabinet the government to imagine that these are your children the plight of the hostages has captured the nation s attention for the past three weeks israeli media are filled with stories about the hostages and interviews with their families but all of the military s options carry enormous risks a military invasion raises the prospect of intractable warfare in densely populated cities and subterranean tunnels that could suck young soldiers into a monthslong quagmire with the hostages believed to be hidden in hamas sprawling tunnel network heavy fighting raises the prospect of unmitigated chaos for soldiers and hostages alike late on friday as the israeli military struck gaza by air land and sea with a ferocity never seen before families of hostages were on edge acutely aware of the dangers facing their loved ones it was a long and sleepless night said liat bell sommer a spokesperson for the families who she said suffered from absolute uncertainty regarding the fate of the hostages held there who were also subject to the heavy bombings the bombardment seemed to send a message to hamas if the group thought it could avoid a devastating ground invasion because of the captives in gaza it was wrong balancing the families interests with the military goal of destroying hamas has presented a dilemma for netanyahu who is for his government s failure to prevent the worst attack in israeli history and to swiftly come to people s aid that day amos yadlin a retired general and former head of israel s military intelligence said the government s challenge was to satisfy the immense public pressure both to return the hostages safely and wipe out hamas he insisted the two goals could be reconciled if the government finds the right strategy both should be handled simultaneously and should support each other yadlin said without elaborating but many experts believe the best strategy to save hostages remains diplomacy hamas on saturday offered israel an exchange the release of all hostages in gaza for all palestinian prisoners held by israel the plight of the prisoners is deeply emotional for palestinians who widely see the prisoners as freedom fighters israel has a long history of agreeing to lopsided prisoner swaps in 2011 it freed over 1 000 prisoners in exchange for gilad schalit a soldier who was kidnapped and dragged across the border into gaza many of those prisoners including hamas top leader in gaza yehia sinwar had been convicted in the killings of israelis if the enemy wants to end this case at once we are ready for that said abu obeida the spokesman for hamas armed wing israeli military spokesperson rear adm daniel hagari was evasive he said hamas was engaged in the cynical exploitation of the anxieties gripping the israeli public but families who saw four women released to israel last week following complex hostage diplomacy said they weren t convinced that the israeli government had their best interests in mind they feel like they re left behind and no one is really caring about them said miki haimovitz a former lawmaker who spoke on behalf of the hostages families at saturday s protest no one is explaining what s going on

Jim Mustian",2023-10-28 00:00:00,police across maine were alerted just last month to veiled threats by the u s army reservist who would go on to carry out the worst mass shooting in the state s history one of a string of missed red flags that preceded the massacre two local law enforcement chiefs told the associated press that a statewide awareness alert was sent in mid september to be on the lookout for robert card after the firearms instructor made threats against his base and fellow soldiers but after stepped up patrols of the base and a visit to card s home neither of which turned up any sign of him they moved on we added extra patrols we did that for about two weeks the guy never showed up said jack clements the police chief in saco home to the u s army reserve base where card trained sagadahoc county sheriff joel merry whose jurisdiction includes card s home in bowdoin said the army reserve tipped his department in september to the reservist s threats and the sheriff sent the awareness alert to every law enforcement agency in the state after his deputy came back empty handed from a welfare check to card s home we couldn t locate him merry said adding that he couldn t recall if there was any follow up because i don t have any reports in front of me military officials declined to comment further about card specifically whether the threats relayed to the sheriff in september were new or the same ones card had made during an army reserve training exercise near west point new york in july that s when police say card was committed to a mental health facility for two weeks after acting erratically and hearing voices and threats to shoot up a military base authorities say the 40 year old card opened fire with a high powered rifle on a bowling alley and then a bar in lewiston wednesday night killing and wounding 13 more after an intensive that put the state on edge card was found dead friday from a self inflicted gunshot despite the earlier threats the said saturday card had not been on its radar telling ap it did not have nor did it receive any tips or information concerning robert card the bureau added that its instant background check system was not provided with or in possession of any information that would have prohibited card from a lawful firearm purchase card s case stands as a glaring example of missed red flags with many unanswered questions about what the military police mental health professionals and relatives could have done to prevent the massacre while maine does not have a red flag law it does have a more limited law that would still allow police to petition a judge to take a person s firearms away if a medical practitioner deems that person to be a threat for his part saco police chief clements defended his department s response to the alert about card which he described as a generic thing that came out saying hey you know we ve had some report that this guy s made some veiled threats clements noted that his department gets many such alerts and that his officers gave this one its due attention keeping an eye on the base for any sign of card never came in contact with this guy never received any phone calls from the reserve center saying hey we got somebody who was causing a problem he said we never got anything another law enforcement agency that came in contact with card was the new york state police which on july 16 was called in west point by commanders of the army reserve s 3rd battalion 304th infantry regiment with concerns about card s erratic behavior and threats to other members of his military unit during a training exercise according to a state police document obtained by ap state police troopers took card a sergeant 1st class to the keller army community hospital at west

decades before starting a criminal defense practice said when soldiers are committed involuntarily to mental health facilities by others in the chain of command it is a reportable event under army regulations that triggers a requirement to alert others a provost marshal enters the incident into a military database that puts the fbi on notice so it can enter the name into a background list of people prevented from buying weapons if they took him and he didn t want to go and he refused to be admitted it s a slam dunk crisp said this should have been reported but maine department of public safety commissioner michael sauschuck said in news conference saturday that while card had a history of mental illness there was no evidence that he had ever been involuntarily committed just because there appears to be a mental health nexus to this scenario the vast majority of people with mental health diagnosis will never hurt anybody sauschuck said jody madeira an indiana university law professor who has studied gun laws said police in one state can alert counterparts in another state that someone is a danger and the military can do the same with local police she said someone dropped

one he argues where finally finding agreement on a long sought to the israel palestinian conflict should be a priority there s no going back to the status quo as it stood on oct 6 biden told reporters referring to the day before hamas militants attacked israel and set off the latest war the white house says biden conveyed the same message directly to netanyahu during a telephone call this past week it also means that when this crisis is over there has to be a vision of what comes next and in our view it has to be a two state solution biden said the push for a two state solution one in which israel would co exist with an independent palestinian state has eluded u s presidents and middle east diplomats for decades it s been put on the back burner since the last american led effort at peace talks collapsed in 2014 amid disagreements on israeli settlements the release of palestinian prisoners and other issues palestinian statehood is something that biden of his administration during his visit to the west bank last year biden said the for new attempts to reach a permanent peace even as he reiterated to palestinians the long held u s support for statehood now at a moment of heightened concern that the israel hamas war could spiral into a broader regional conflict biden has begun to emphasize that once the bombing and shooting stop working toward a palestinian state should no longer be ignored until recently biden had put far more emphasis on what his administration saw as the achievable ambition of than on restarting peace talks even his national security adviser jake sullivan in a lengthy essay that was written shortly before the oct 7 attack and described biden s global foreign policy efforts made no mention of palestinian statehood in an posted online sullivan wrote that the administration was committed to a two state solution white house official also say the normalization talks have always included significant proposals to benefit the palestinians there is no shortage of obstacles in the way of biden s postwar vision an independent palestinian state in the west bank and gaza is viewed as a nonstarter by israel s far right government an ineffectual palestinian authority controls the west bank and has little credibility with the population it governs meantime a looming u s presidential election could make biden a less than ideal mediator in 2024 aaron david miller who served as an adviser on middle east issues to democratic and republican administrations said biden s recent emphasis on a two state solution was an aspirational talking point the odds are very very low he said it s essentially mission impossible the call for a two state solution arose saturday at the republican jewish coalition summit in las vegas where gop presidential contenders criticized biden s israel policy and what they saw as a failure by to sufficiently condemn antisemitism across the united states one presidential hopeful biotech entrepreneur vivek ramaswamy said israel should feel free to abandon the myth of a two state solution the white house is cognizant that biden s calls for a two state solution are ambitious and are perhaps not achievable in the near term according to a white house official who was not authorized to publicly discuss internal deliberations and spoke on condition of anonymity there is also a recognition that the netanyahu government facing public backlash for the hamas attack is focused on its operations against hamas and is not giving much consideration to biden s talk of palestinian statehood still biden believes it is important for him and his team to convey hope and make clear that his administration backs a palestinian state the official said dennis ross a negotiator in the peace process in both the george h w bush and bill clinton administrations said it is important to start planning for down the road even though there is no end in sight for the current conflict you can t go back to the point where you can ignore the palestinians as an issue ross said it s not hopeless when you get beyond this it s not hopeless the renewed calls for palestinian statehood also come as palestinian american groups muslim advocacy organizations and that biden continues to express full throated support for israel at a time when the palestinian death count is mounting and the humanitarian crisis in gaza worsening this is not about someone s faith said white house national security council spokesman john kirby said it s about finding a future for the middle east that is more cooperative more stable more secure where israel s more integrated into the region and we re not giving up on it biden has expressed concern about deteriorating conditions for innocent civilians in gaza but his insistence that he will not dictate how israeli forces carry out their operations could complicate his ability to maintain credibility as an evenhanded broker u s muslim leaders at a private white house meeting with biden and top aides this past week urged the president to call for a cease fire participants also told biden that his silence on what they perceive as collective punishment by israel against innocent gaza civilians was undercutting his standing with arab americans and muslims including in states that could have a big impact on the 2024 election they also expressed their concern to biden over his statement that he has no confidence in the gaza death count because it is tabulated the hamas run health ministry the ministry says more than 8 000 people mostly women and minors have been killed in gaza more than 1 400 people have died on the israeli side mainly civilians killed during the initial hamas onslaught rami nashashibi the founder of the inner city muslim action network in chicago and a participant in the meeting said he told biden that his comments about the death toll in gaza came off as dehumanizing nashashibi added that he and the other

00:00:00,washington ap embarrassing chaotic and irresponsible and those were just the words that house used to describe as they removed one speaker from office and splintered over three successive nominees before finally landing on r la now they hope voters won t hold the gop s infighting against them as they seek to hold onto their exceedingly narrow house majority in next year s election republicans already had a tough task on their hands they can afford to lose only four seats to maintain the majority and 18 of their incumbents are running in districts won by president in 2020 a supreme court decision siding with black voters in a redistricting lawsuit could give a pick up opportunity in alabama and republican extensive legal troubles will make it harder for the gop to keep that long island based district in the republican column some republicans worry the infighting that essentially shuttered the house for three weeks will serve as a further headwind against republicans in their bid to stay in the majority some already sounded resigned to serving in the minority during the past week s ups and downs in finding a new speaker while others voiced hopes the passage of time will make the past three weeks a distant memory look it s not going to be great for 24 i m not optimistic about keeping a majority because of the eight individuals actions said rep max miller a first term republican from ohio but i just continue to stress that 4 of the conference did this it s not indicative of the republican party miller was referring to the eight republicans who voted with democrats to oust mccarthy as speaker after just nine months on the job republicans also look to put some of the onus for the past three weeks on democrats i think it has damaged the party but we have to remember who plunged us into chaos it was eight right wing fringe republicans and every single democrat said rep nicole malliotakis r n y they worked with the very people they tell us to run from to take out a speaker that 97 of our conference supported without zero plan on what to do next rep suzan delbene the chair of the campaign arm for house democrats said candidates in key swing districts will contrast the fractures among house republicans with a democratic focus on the need to govern and meet constituents priorities the no 1 thing you hear from folks is why don t folks focus on governing why is there so much infighting and this isn t fighting between parties this is republicans fighting with republicans bullying republicans even threatening each other that s what the american people are seeing right now delbene said one republican strategist harkened back to similar turmoil a decade ago to argue that gop candidates will probably emerge unscathed from the recent house chaos in 2013 house republicans engineered a showdown over the affordable care act insisting that a spending bill to avoid a shutdown include measures to roll back key parts of then president barack obama s health care law the republican controlled house passed two spending bills with amendments aimed at crippling the law the senate which was controlled by democrats rejected both measures that left house republicans with the choice of funding the government or shutting it down over their opposition to the healthcare law and they chose the latter i remember working in the house in the 2013 shutdown and part of why we did that was we thought our members needed to touch the hot stove and realize they were going to get burnt said doug heye who worked under then house majority leader eric cantor r va and the reality is nothing happened there was no political price for any of those members to pay the following year house republicans gained 13 seats in the election giving them their largest majority since president herbert hoover s administration and they gained nine senate seats retaking the majority that was a midterm election in which members of the party not in control of the white house tend to perform better next year the nominees for the presidency will be the center of attention for voters with a likely rematch between biden and former president donald trump how the eventual nominees fare will go a long way in determining congressional races as americans increasingly vote along party lines the only saving grace is that biden s economic numbers are in the toilet said rep don bacon r neb who represents one of the more evenly divided districts in the country in the end i think americans will be more worried about the state of the country the economy the foreign policy stuff but this surely doesn t help us rep marc molinaro a first term republican from new york said he hopes voters will judge the republican candidates on the totality of their work the last three weeks were among the most distressing and disappointing not only for me but among the most distressing and disappointing in the history of that chamber he said nodding toward the house side of the capitol we should be judged by not only those three weeks but how we now rebuild moving forward rep david schweikert who represents an arizona district biden carried in 2020 said he was going on radio shows and having conversations in costco to get the message out that the house s dysfunction was to be blamed on a handful of republicans acting out of emotion rather than ideology you don t hide from it you say look this is embarrassing he said he said the debacle may hurt generic republicans trying to win in swing districts but also contended that the election is still a far way off and argued it would be a distant memory by next november the fractures in the republican party that dogged mccarthy during his short tenure aren t going away just because the house has a new speaker in just a few weeks house republicans are going to have to find a way to fund the government at levels that the white house and a democratic led senate will accept or risk a government shutdown further turmoil will only feed into the democratic argument that house republicans are incapable of governing going into the ballot booth in november i don t think many people are going to remember anything

around the clock how long it might take is anyone s guess maine public safety commissioner mike sauschuck announced in a press conference that officials would hold regular 10 a m media briefings to go over what happened overnight and share details on that day s search plan there s going to be times when i won t be able to give you all the information that you need or that you want sauschuck told reporters there are safety concerns that i have for our first responders and that we all have for our community members law enforcement is working to assess more than 500 leads received so far he said with help from the police activity would be concentrated friday in a handful of areas particularly the bend along the androscoggin river where card may have kept a boat state police have said that card s white suv was in lisbon falls he also has two watercraft registered in his name one being a 1989 bayliner it remains unclear whether card is dead or alive on land or somewhere along the state s thousands of miles of tidal coastline canadian border authorities have also been put on alert for card the very first thing that you re going to see out there sauschuck said gesturing to a map of the river is you re going to see some air resources that will fly over this particular area and they re looking to see what can we clear from the air do i have to put divers in that particular area or can i tell from the top based on the current and how muddy the water is and all these other things can i see to the very bottom here he continued then there s going to be some screening and divers that are actually in the water that search is expected to start by the lisbon falls boat launch and likely move south across the river to include a ground search on the opposite bank while some outlets reported card leaving a note sauschuck declined to address its contents that the note indicated card did not expect to be found alive the river search teams can be dragging the diver behind them literally while that diver is checking for evidence checking for potential bodies sauschuck said some will use sonar in the form of a remote operated aquatic vehicle that looks like a pod under the water he said to help differentiate a log for example from a potential piece of evidence i would also say that while this is going to look like a major focus today with a lot of people we have a lot of other irons in the fire he added a huge flurry of police activity outside a home owned by a relative of card s in bowdoin maine prompted speculation thursday evening that law enforcement might have been closing in on their suspect video of the scene showed officers using a loudspeaker to order anyone inside to come out with their hands in the air sauschuck appeared to address the speculation friday morning saying that announcements over a pa system do not mean authorities have pinned down the suspect in an armed standoff it s just a lot of resources that it takes to work these scenes he said noting that officials treat locations of interest like the bowdoin home as if the suspect could be inside and armed sauschuck said there were a bunch of other scenes that authorities planned to search as well we re going to be all over the place he said some searches might involve armored vehicles while others are made up of officers walking shoulder to shoulder some of those are going to be tactical ground searches versus the standard line search or grid search sauschuck said sauschuck noted that the brookfield power company has been helping by working with authorities to manipulate the river using two dams that it operates in the area the river currently runs at like 8 500 cubic square feet per second and when they tighten the dam they actually lower that down to like 5 500 cubic feet he said a slower current and a lower water level make it easier to search the river is a big piece of this the car was located there evidence was located in the vehicle that s stuff that we want to make sure that we re checking sauschuck said meanwhile officers are continuing to sweep the two main crime scenes the restaurant schemengees and the bowling alley just in time where the gunfire erupted not only do you have the victims in question but every one of those rounds that got fired need to be investigated sauschuck said every one of those cartridges that lay on the ground needs to be collected every vehicle in those parking lots everything that we do around this we need to be careful we need to be professional another press conference is expected later on friday

there a lot to consider the louisiana republican now in his fourth term led efforts to overturn the 2020 election he voted for a national abortion ban he has called for criminalizing gay sex but wait there s more johnson also has supported repeal of the affordable care act a k a obamacare you might be thinking it doesn t really matter republicans control neither the senate nor the white house after all and these days they don t seem especially interested in health care anyway during the big 2019 20 legislative fight over president joe biden s proposal to lower prescription drug costs the most notable thing about the republican opposition was the lack of it they barely said a word the same goes for the affordable care act which is quite a change from the many years republicans talked endlessly about repealing it they finally got their chance in 2017 while donald trump was president and johnson then new to congress voted yes the effort famously failed but not before provoking a massive political backlash that helped democrats retake control of the house and two years later the presidency and senate too these days it s news when a republican even says the word obamacare but that doesn t mean republicans have made their peace with the 2010 health care law or that they ve given up on their ideas for replacing it with conservative alternatives and you ll find no better proof than in a 2019 proposal from the republican study committee which at the time johnson was the word repeal appears only a few times always in a narrow context but the pieces of repeal legislation are all there three in particular stand out about half of the 58 page document is a look at the high cost of american health care its effects on individual americans and the many ways according to republicans the affordable care act is responsible for these problems a big focus is the law s regulations prohibiting insurers from denying coverage or charging higher premiums to people with preexisting conditions and requiring that all policies include basic essential benefits the report says these regulations made insurance more expensive in the sense that it means insurers today can t turn away people with serious medical needs or stop paying their bills that costs money and while the gop report acknowledges that the affordable care act s tax credits offset those higher costs for most people it says that s an inefficient way to get people coverage and warns that it still leaves many americans with high bills again there s a lot of truth to both but the republican alternative johnson and his allies supported would roll back the existing regulations preserving guarantees of coverage only for people who keep continuous coverage and ending the federal requirements on essential benefits and it would end the current subsidy scheme replacing it through a mix of tax changes and support for new savings accounts it s hard to be precise about the effects this would all have today because the gop report doesn t have a detailed budget but at a conceptual level this is pretty much what republicans were proposing with their repeal bills in 2017 fewer rules governing what insurance has to cover and less government assistance to help people buy insurance virtually every independent analysis at the time concluded people in good health could get access to cheaper insurance premiums but only because people in worse health would be stuck with higher premiums or out of pocket expenses or no ability to get coverage at all to put it more simply it was a way of shifting the costs of medical care onto the there s every reason to think the proposal johnson and his allies published in 2019 would do the same thing the gop report has a whole section on what it calls the aca s failed medicaid expansion that s a reference to arguably the law s most consequential change federal funding that allows states to expand medicaid the half century old insurance program for low income americans so that anybody with income below or just above the poverty line is eligible previously most states limited enrollment to certain groups of people like children and pregnant women and that s not the kind of spending republicans or johnson have ever supported for this sort of program the gop document envisions ending the expansion in a two step process it would start with a moratorium on new state expansions at a time when resistance in holdout states has been softening expansion has even picked up some momentum in mississippi then the federal government would reduce the extra money it s been providing states for expansion until there was no extra money at all analysis of similar provisions in the 2017 repeal proposals predicted a rollback would cause millions to lose their insurance coverage the gop document doesn t directly acknowledge this tellingly the word uninsured appears only a half dozen times the gop document johnson and his allies produced has other elements too some novel some familiar to anybody who remembers the repeal battle but the basics haven t changed republicans have been very quiet publicly of late about repealing the aca but this proposal would be just as sweeping in its effects as the repeal and replace plans congress debated in 2017 larry levitt kff s executive vice president for health told me via email the big question at this point is whether republicans would actually take another run at repeal given the political hazards polls show a majority of americans now support the affordable care act and for all of its flaws and inadequacies it s become part of the status quo people have come to expect its protections in a way that historically has made programs difficult to dislodge i wrote a book on that transformation if you re interested johnson for his part hasn t said it is a priority or even if he stands by the proposal he and his allies put out in 2019 when i asked his office about it on friday corrine day his communications director gave me this statement the speaker will work within the conference to build consensus on a health care plan the conference acknowledges the need to fix our broken system and they will examine solutions to increase quality of care and reduce cost but the lack of political visibility for health care generally and obamacare specifically can cut both ways precisely because republicans like johnson no longer talk about repeal describing their initiatives as efforts to personalize health care and protect the vulnerable few seem aware of what they are actually proposing that could make it easier to enact their agenda or at least big chunks of it

to a request for comment about his views on whose adherents believe the planet is 6 000 years old and that humans walked the earth at the same time as dinosaurs the scientific community regards creationism as pseudoscience and is generally in agreement the earth is an estimated 4 5 billion years old in the limited time that reporters and researchers have had to dig deeply into johnson s life he became a national gop figure only in the last week and hails from a noncompetitive district in louisiana it does not appear johnson has publicly said anything to suggest he doesn t accept the theory of evolution reporters have however in johnson s not so recent past but he has appeared sympathetic to the creationist cause and has fiercely defended its followers on first amendment grounds in a sermon delivered in 2016 at christian center shreveport in louisiana johnson also blamed school shootings on a lack of godliness that he suggested was rooted in teaching children they evolve from the primordial slime in addition to his work with answers in genesis johnson has been the national council on bible curriculum in public schools over education about evolution the teaching of evolution in public schools has been controversial for more than a century states began passing laws banning the teaching of evolution in the early 20th century which led to the infamous 1925 scopes monkey trial but it wasn t until 1968 that the u s supreme court ruled in epperson v arkansas that bans on teaching evolution were unconstitutional later court decisions prohibited the teaching of creation science in 1987 and in 2005 in public schools johnson s critics fear he would try to inject christian ideology into how he governs the u s house as second in line for the presidency they also see young earth creationism as a tentacle of the whose goal is to create a christian theocracy in the u s his policy agenda appears to be in lockstep with that of a shadow network of christian nationalist groups in our country or working to preserve traditional power structures and win privilege for conservative christianity said rachel laser the president of americans united for separation of church and state as a state representative in 2015 johnson came to the defense of a louisiana public school district under fire for making creationism and bible study part of its curriculum and offered to defend the district for free through his christian law firm freedom guard johnson has described freedom guard as a public interest law firm the concern that you re articulating should be of concern to more than just creationists johnson said who described being forced to learn what he called false evolutionary theories in school all freedom loving americans ought to have grave concerns about these government abuses regardless of their perspectives on genesis or even the christian faith for that matter william trollinger the author of said the answers in genesis exhibits instead of being insulated from politics are deeply reflective of the nation s divides these are culture war sites young earth creationism is very much a part of maga culture trollinger told huffpost noting that in his experience there are very few politically moderate young earth creationists in the united states in september 2022 johnson and his wife hosted ham on their truth be told podcast which has been around since march of that year in their conversation the johnsons heavily promoted ham s creation museum in petersburg kentucky for all of our friends who have not made a visit it s hard to describe mike johnson said it s really an awesome experience during their discussion ham blamed the teaching of atheistic evolution for corrupting the youth and leading them to turn away from the church he argued that instead church leaders and parents need to teach children how to defend church doctrine through biblical study and argument so that they will know and be able to properly argue that the fossil record wasn t laid down over millions of years that s the graveyard of the flood to teach them all these things that s what s been missing from the church ham said i think that s right johnson replied at the end of their conversation johnson again praised ham s creation museum and the ark encounter for doing maybe the best work right now in our generation of pointing people to the truth

Baldor,2023-10-27 00:00:00,washington ap u s fighter jets launched airstrikes early friday on two locations in eastern syria linked to iran s revolutionary guard corps the pentagon said in retaliation for a slew of drone and missile in the region that began early last week the u s strikes reflect the biden administration s determination to maintain a delicate balance the u s wants to hit iranian backed groups suspected of targeting the u s as strongly as possible to deter future aggression possibly fueled by while also working to avoid inflaming the region and provoking a wider conflict according to a senior u s military official the precision strikes were carried out near boukamal by two f 16 fighter jets and they struck weapons and ammunition storage areas that were connected to the irgc the official said there had been iranian aligned militia and irgc personnel on the base and no civilians but the u s does not have any information yet on casualties or an assessment of damage the official would not say how many munitions were launched by the f 16s a senior defense official said the sites were chosen because the irgc stores the types of munitions there that were used in the strikes against u s bases and troops the two officials briefed reporters after the strikes on condition of anonymity to provide details on the mission that had not yet been made public according to the pentagon there have now been at least 19 attacks on u s bases and personnel in iraq and syria since oct 17 including three new ones thursday air force brig gen pat ryder said 21 u s personnel were injured in two of those assaults that used drones to target al asad airbase in iraq and al tanf garrison in syria in a statement defense secretary lloyd austin said the precision self defense strikes are a response to a series of ongoing and mostly unsuccessful attacks against u s personnel in iraq and syria by iranian backed militia groups that began on october 17 he said president joe biden directed the narrowly tailored strikes to make clear that the united states will not tolerate such attacks and will defend itself its personnel and its interests and he added that the operation was separate and distinct from israel s war against hamas the senior defense official told reporters that the f 16 airstrikes will have a significant impact on the ability of iranian proxy groups to continue to attack u s forces asked what groups were targeted the official said there are several that can have different names but the u s holds tehran responsible for funding arming equipping and directing the proxies the official said the airstrikes were not designed to expand the conflict in the region but to compel iran to direct the militia groups to cease the attacks on american bases and personnel the biden administration has not accused iran of having a direct role in the oct 7 hamas attack on israel and has said it appears so far that tehran was not aware of it beforehand but the u s has noted that iran has long supported hamas and has raised concerns that iran and its proxies could turn the conflict into a wider war austin said the u s does not seek a broader conflict but if iranian proxy groups continue the u s won t hesitate to take additional action to protect its forces according to the pentagon all the u s personnel hurt in the militant attacks received minor injuries and all returned to duty in addition a contractor suffered a cardiac arrest and died while seeking shelter from a possible drone attack the retaliatory strikes came as no surprise officials at the pentagon and the white house have made it clear for the past week that the u s would respond with ryder saying again thursday that it would be at the time and place of our choosing i think we ve been crystal clear that we maintain the inherent right of defending our troops and we will take all necessary measures to protect our forces and our interests overseas he told reporters during a pentagon briefing earlier in the day biden said wednesday that he had warned ayatollah ali khamenei iran s supreme leader that if tehran continues to move against u s forces in the middle east we will respond the latest spate of strikes by the iranian linked groups came in the wake of a deadly explosion at a gaza hospital triggering protests in a number of muslim nations the israeli military has relentlessly attacked gaza in retaliation for the devastating hamas rampage in southern israel nearly three weeks ago but israel has denied responsibility for the al ahli hospital blast and the u s has said its intelligence assessment found that tel aviv was not to blame the u s including the pentagon has repeatedly said any strike response by america would be directly tied to the attacks on the troops and not connected to the war between israel and hamas such retaliation and strikes against iranian targets in syria after similar attacks on u s bases are routine in march for example the u s struck sites in syria used by groups affiliated with iran s revolutionary guard after an iranian linked attack killed a u s contractor and wounded seven other americans in northeast syria american f 15 fighter jets flying out of al udeid air base in qatar struck several locations around deir el zour u s officials have routinely stressed that the american response is designed to be proportional and is aimed at deterring strikes against u s personnel who are focused on the fight against the islamic state group u s officials have not publicly tied the recent string of attacks in syria and iraq to the violence in gaza but iranian officials have openly criticized the u s for providing weapons to israel that have been used to strike gaza resulting in civilian death the pentagon meanwhile has beefed up air defenses in the region to protect u s forces the u s has said it is sending several batteries of patriot missile systems a terminal high altitude area defense thaad battery and additional fighter jets the thaad is being sent from fort bliss texas and the patriot batteries are from fort liberty in north carolina and fort sill in oklahoma an avenger air defense system from fort liberty is also being sent officials have said as much as two battalions of patriots are being deployed a battalion can include at least three patriot batteries which each have six to eight launchers ryder said thursday that about 900 troops have deployed or are in the process of going to the middle east region including those associated with the air defense systems

00:00:00,president on wednesday cast doubt on the casualty figures reported from as continues its u s backed military operation there reporters i have no notion that the palestinians are telling the truth about how many people are killed but within biden s own administration officials have consistently cited the death toll and other data provided by authorities inside gaza according to a huffpost review of internal state department documents huffpost reviewed nearly 20 state department situation reports with the earliest dating from oct 8 the day after the palestinian militant group hamas launched a devastating attack inside israel that killed 1 400 people and sparked the current fighting most were prepared by the u s embassy in jerusalem and then circulated to a broad group of department officials working on issues related to israel palestine situation reports such as these represent u s assessments from the ground that are intended to inform policy discussions and decision making in washington in at least 12 instances u s embassy officials attributed the number of palestinian casualties to the hamas linked health ministry in gaza including in the report provided to state department colleagues on oct 25 hours before biden s remarks in two reports written by state s operations center and circulated within the department on oct 24 and 25 administration officials reported casualties in gaza by citing two outside sources who quoted the gaza ministry in their reports and the nonprofit and in one instance in which a situation report questioned the accuracy of figures from the gaza ministry on oct 21 the american official drafting the note wrote of the number of gazans killed or injured the previous day the numbers are likely much higher according to the un and ngos reporting on the situation that cable and one other are the only examples in which the reports include caveats about the ministry s data saying authorities inside gaza have effectively crumbled reducing the credibility of de facto authority ministry of health provided data cables issued subsequently do not include that caveat and continue citing the ministry figures the same way they cite figures from israel s ministry of health the credibility of the ministry s data is significant because there are few other sources of information about the situation in the blockaded region and because some defenders of israel s actions in gaza claim the ministry overstates the humanitarian toll of israeli attacks for political reasons most organizations and analysts tracking gaza do treat the ministry as however including the the state department has also publicly cited the ministry s figures for example published earlier this year on the human rights situation in israel palestine it s unclear whether biden received specific information that motivated his wednesday comments asked about the ministry s assessment that israeli attacks on gaza since oct 7 had killed more than 6 000 palestinians including 2 700 children the president said i m sure innocents have been killed and that s the price of waging a war i think we should be incredibly careful not we the israelis should be incredibly careful to be sure that they re focusing on going after the folks that are propagating this war against israel and it s against their interests when that doesn t happen but i have no confidence in the number that the palestinians are using biden said on thursday a state department spokesperson told huffpost no one is questioning the scope of the humanitarian crisis in gaza or the significant number of civilian lives that have been lost the hamas run ministry of health has a track record of reporting inaccurate numbers and inflating death tolls the spokesperson continued unfortunately given the limited ability of outside parties to verify figures provided by hamas it remains difficult to determine the total number of civilian casualties in gaza and no other alternatives exist at this time to the metrics provided by the hamas run ministry of health the department of state will continue to include data from a variety of sources for its internal reporting this is not indicative of how accurate we assess those data points to be the gaza health ministry responded to biden s statement on thursday by a list of names of people killed since oct 7 most of the state department reports seen by huffpost cite the ministry as the source of information for casualties in gaza the u s officials who wrote them attribute casualties in the other occupied palestinian territory the west bank to the ministry of health in the palestinian authority which controls some parts of the region and is a separate entity from gaza s ministry of health experts who count on the gaza ministry they treat it as trustworthy because of its track record over many years including past periods of conflict between israel and hamas and because it has unique information from sources like local morgues and medical facilities the u n s office for the coordination of humanitarian affairs has its for the israeli palestinian conflict but its assessments are released more slowly because it almost always relies on two sources for statistics on deaths and injuries the state department cables vary in how they describe the gaza ministry s relationship with hamas a point of contention that has become especially important amid an ongoing controversy over a hospital bombing in gaza last week soon after the explosion cited the ministry saying it was caused by an israeli airstrike and had caused nearly 500 deaths israel in turn blamed the blast on a misfired rocket by the militant group palestinian islamic jihad u s intelligence agencies later the toll was between 100 and 300 and the and published clarifying statements about their coverage israel s government had accused the bbc of a modern blood libel multiple state department reports prior to the al ahli hospital disaster on oct 17 describe the ministry as the de facto ministry of health in gaza or use the term de facto authority reports sent afterward include a reference to hamas with some using the term hamas run one cable sent on oct 12 cites the de facto deputy health minister in gaza yousef abu al reesh on oct 23 a cable did not provide a new casualty number for gazans noting the ministry had not published new figures since the previous day two cables describe the authorities in gaza as crumbling amid the impact of israel s campaign which has destroyed large swaths of the area s civilian infrastructure the chief u n aid agency operating in the strip that the lack of fuel in the area which can only receive supplies through israel and egypt is making it harder to help people amid the fighting current stocks are almost completely exhausted forcing life saving services to come to a halt the u n relief and works agency wrote in its latest update this includes the supply of piped

again in recent days entire rows of residential buildings simply disappear in the photos reduced to smears of dust and rubble a complex of 13 high rises by the sea was pounded to dust near gaza city s al shati refugee camp leaving only a few tottering bits of facade just down the street hardly anything remained in what had been a neighborhood of low built homes on winding lanes according to the photos by maxar technologies new strikes thursday leveled more than eight homes belonging to an extended family killing at least 15 people in the southern city of khan younis in the chaotic wasteland of crumbled concrete and twisted metal rescuers lifted the body of a boy from beneath a slab the israeli military said an airstrike killed one of two masterminds of the oct 7 massacre shadi barud the head of hamas intelligence unit the military says it only strikes militant targets and accuses hamas of operating among civilians in an attempt to protect its fighters palestinian militants have fired thousands of rockets into israel since the war began one struck a residential building in the central city of petah tikva without wounding anyone hamas military wing said thursday that israeli bombardment has so far killed about 50 of the at least 224 hostages the militants abducted during its oct 7 assault there was no immediate comment from israeli officials who have denied previous similar claims family members and jewish groups are trying to keep the spotlight on the hostages plight in paris 30 empty baby strollers were displayed in front of the eiffel tower each with a photo of one of the children taken from israel a day earlier blindfolded teddy bears with photos of the abducted children were placed in front of a fountain in tel aviv the conflict has threatened to ignite a wider war across the region hezbollah an iranian backed ally of hamas in lebanon has repeatedly traded fire with israel along the border the united states has sent to the region two aircraft carrier strike groups along with additional fighter jets and other weaponry and personnel in a statement thursday night u s defense secretary lloyd austin said the strikes in eastern syria were a response to a series of ongoing and mostly unsuccessful attacks against u s personnel in iraq and syria by iranian backed militia groups that began on oct 17 he said president joe biden directed the narrowly tailored strikes to make clear that the united states will not tolerate such attacks and will defend itself its personnel and its interests he added that the operation was separate and distinct from israel s war against hamas israel has to govern gaza or threaten israel again but also says it doesn t want to reoccupy the territory from which it withdrew soldiers and settlers in 2005 that could prove a daunting challenge since hamas is deeply rooted in gaza with political and charity organizations as well as a formidable armed wing benny gantz a retired general and a member of israel s war cabinet said any possible ground offensive would be only one stage in a long term process that includes security political and social aspects that will take years the campaign will soon ramp up with greater force he added the overnight raid into gaza was the largest of several known brief incursions the military said soldiers and tanks killed fighters and destroyed tunnels and anti tank missile launching positions the military said no israelis were wounded there was no immediate confirmation of any palestinian casualties rear adm daniel hagari a military spokesman said the incursion was part of our preparations for the next stages of the war israel also said it also carried out around 250 airstrikes across gaza in the last 24 hours targeting tunnel shafts rocket launchers and other militant infrastructure its reported targeting could not be independently verified the figure of 7 000 deaths reported by the gaza health ministry is more than three times the number of palestinians killed in the six week long gaza war in 2014 the ministry s toll includes more than 2 900 minors and more than 1 500 women after biden said he had no confidence in gaza s casualty figures the health ministry on thursday countered by releasing a more than 200 page document listing the names of 6 747 dead including ages and gender it said another 281 dead had not been identified and that hundreds still missing under rubble were not included in the count the warning by the u n agency for palestinian refugees unrwa over depleting fuel supplies raised alarm that the humanitarian crisis could quickly worsen israel is still barring deliveries of fuel needed to power generators saying it believes hamas will take it for military use about 1 4 million of gaza s 2 3 million residents have fled their homes with nearly half of them crowding into u n shelters despite israel ordering them to evacuate to the south and saying that those who remain might be considered accomplices of hamas in recent days israel has let more than 70 trucks with aid enter from egypt this is a small amount of what is required a drop in the ocean said william schomburg an official with the international committee of the red cross in gaza we are trying to establish a pipeline elsewhere egyptian state run media outlet al qahera news reported early friday that an explosion hit the egyptian resort town of taba which is near the border with israel five people were wounded the cause of the blast was not immediately clear and the associated press could not immediately confirm the details nine arab countries including key u s allies and nations that have signed peace or normalization deals with israel issued a joint statement thursday calling for an immediate cease fire and an end to the targeting and death of civilians the right to self defense by the united nations charter does not justify blatant violations of humanitarian and international law said the statement signed by egypt jordan bahrain the united arab emirates saudi arabia oman qatar kuwait and morocco in the occupied west bank israeli authorities detained 86 palestinians including five women in multiple raids overnight bringing the total detained there to more than 1 400 according to the palestinian prisoners club which represents former and current prisoners at least 104 palestinians have been killed in

phenom spoke out about her journey since coming out in the most public way.,Josephine Harvey,2023-10-25 00:00:00,last year justine lindsay made two of the biggest announcements of her life in one giddy she s transgender and she had landed herself a spot on an nfl cheerleading squad it was more than just a huge personal moment in joining the carolina topcats who cheer for the carolina panthers lindsay was becoming the in a space known for its there were highs and lows during her first year on the job triumphant performances coping with harassment threats and abuse but as she stepped onto the field for her second season last month lindsay was decidedly joyous about the chance to keep on performing i love it wouldn t change it for the world she told huffpost in an interview on her 31st birthday for lindsay it all boils down to her lifelong passion for dance that s what got her here and that s her focus but as a trans woman following her passion also happens to thrust her into a new role as a trailblazer providing much needed visibility for her community amid an alarming rise in i m just a regular person but i just felt like at the same time i have a story to tell she said off the field some of lindsay s most treasured moments since dancing her way into the limelight have been interactions with people touched by her story it really touches your soul because you know it s bigger than me she said everything that i do it s always bigger than me it s gonna help the next generation messages from the parents of lgbtq kids in particular really hit home they re trying to navigate what are they going to do how can they support their child lindsay said so to get those messages like those dms in my phone saying your story just really empowered me to be a better parent for my child and just say thank you you know for my story it does something to you it really does it just lets you know wow i m really changing the world she added lindsay came out to her family years ago and transitioned in college but she kept it mostly under wraps when she applied for the topcats gig telling only her coach chandalae lanouette on the application in her march 2022 instagram post lindsay announced the cats out the bag revealing she was trans to her followers and new teammates speaking at the time lanouette emphasized that lindsay was hired for her talent not for making history she s a phenomenal performer without a shadow of a doubt lanouette told huffpost last month and that s kind of the point of our team i want people on the team that just command you to watch them and that s our job on game day is to make people watch us and to entertain them and she could do that just by walking in a room she added still lindsay fields negative comments questioning how she got the job it stuns me and just surprises me how people have so much to say about a person without actually fully knowing them she said honestly it s really sad how does she deal with it rise above it she said using a catchphrase made famous by when they go low you go high in recent years the nfl has sought to improve its reputation in a new social climate and following cheerleading and lawsuits over the involving allegations of misogyny toxic work culture discrimination unfair pay and sexual harassment some teams have made substantial changes like actually paying cheerleaders many squads have allowed men to join other adjustments have been more subtle some teams have as coed dance squads introduced less revealing uniforms or switched their names more black cheerleaders are wearing their hair natural taking steps towards busting the that have long plagued the industry there s still work to be done obviously lindsay who has felt empowered to showcase an array of hairstyles on the job from a bald head to finger waves to long haired looks said of diversity and representation in the league and across the sporting world putting the work in is actually sitting down and having conversations with the right people saying ok how can we figure out a game plan so that everyone is accepted she said the lgbtq advocacy group glaad that while acceptance for the lgbtq community has reached record highs there continues to be a significant lack of understanding and familiarity for trans and nonbinary people according to of lgbtq youth 89 said seeing lgbtq representation in film and television made them feel good about being who they are 67 said the same of seeing out lgbtq athletes seeing justine step into this role has shown that transgender people are welcome and accepted on our teams on the sidelines and in the stands and belong just as they are glaad president and ceo sarah kate ellis said in a statement provided to huffpost justine s talent visibility and joy will always be something to cheer ellis added in recent years right wing politicians have introduced across the country that seek to deny transgender people healthcare education and other basic rights the way forward lindsay believes is to put people like myself and others in front of these podiums and get talking about it instead of people just looking at us as human beings they re just automatically labeling us lindsay said so i want to be able to get in front of these people and just say please relax be quiet let me say what i have to say and that s exactly what she plans to do lindsay s mission is to share her story far and wide and empower others to be their most authentic selves whether it s through or getting herself behind those podiums all over the country but most of all she wants to continue dancing literally until i can t dance anymore

supreme court justice on nov 7 in what will be the latest test of the ongoing political fallout from the u s supreme court s june 2022 decision overturning roe v wade which ended the national right to an abortion since the supreme court s decision in dobbs v jackson women s health organization voided national abortion rights leaving it to states and their allies have leaned hard on the issue of abortion in races up and down the ballot judicial races have received particular attention especially in swing states as state courts have now become the primary battleground for fights over the legality of abortion the race in pennsylvania between democratic nominee and current superior court judge daniel mccaffery and republican nominee and current montgomery county court of common pleas judge carolyn carluccio acts as a test case to indicate how well the anti dobbs message is still working ahead of the 2024 presidential election this race could be a precursor to see if abortion and democracy drive voter performance said j j abbott executive director of commonwealth communications and a spokesperson for the independent campaign effort to elect mccaffery in the 2022 midterm elections abortion was front and center in democrats campaign to beat back an expected red wave that would sweep into office across the country but that wave never broke as republicans barely won control of the u s house lost a seat in the senate and lost key races in a number of swing states that included losing the governor s race and the state assembly in pennsylvania the race between mccaffery and carluccio is set to fill the seat left vacant by the death of chief justice max baer in 2022 the outcome will not determine control of the court as democrats currently hold a 4 2 advantage even with baer s seat vacant but with two retention elections for democratic justices coming up in 2025 it could either set the stage for a republican takeover or help solidify democratic control for years to come the right to an abortion is generally supported by pennsylvanians according to polling conducted in 2022 by franklin marshall college an found that nearly 90 of registered voters in the state thought abortion should be legal in some or all cases three fifths of registered voters also opposed the passage of a constitutional amendment banning abortion though she has made few public statements on her abortion position carluccio has been endorsed by state level anti abortion groups including pa pro life federation and the pro life coalition of pennsylvania those endorsements were touted in mailers during the republican party primary by commonwealth leaders fund an independent expenditure group funded by libertarian investor jeffrey yass planned parenthood and other mccaffery supporters have attacked carluccio for removing a biography with anti abortion rhetoric which said she was a defender of 2nd amendment rights and all life under the law from her website after winning the republican party primary carluccio s campaign in an editorial board interview with pennsylvania newspapers that the bio created by a former political consultant was removed following a website redesign in that same interview she said without specifics that her position was that she follow s the law and added until somebody changes the law that s what i m applying unlike carluccio mccaffery has been vocal in supporting abortion access attacking the dobbs decision and promising in campaign speeches to defend reproductive rights in a mccaffery promised to protect the rights that we democrats have fought for for 60 years women s reproductive rights you think about that that s literally been rolled back and rolled into state court abortion is currently legal in pennsylvania through the 23rd week of pregnancy but that could change if the composition of the state court changes there are challenges to existing abortion laws moving through pennsylvania courts including one lawsuit republicans in the state legislature have also introduced a to ban abortions that could become law if they win back control of state government abortion is clearly on the ballot here breana ross campaign director for planned parenthood votes said the key is to make sure we re educating voters on how this election will affect abortion access the ramifications also go beyond pennsylvania s borders since the u s supreme court s decision overturning roe or are likely to do so while lawsuits move through their court systems residents of those states including pennsylvania s neighbors ohio and west virginia have had to seek abortion care in other states we saw a surge in abortion appointments especially on the western side of the state from women seeking care from out of state said ann steiner an ob gyn and abortion provider in pennsylvania planned parenthood has teamed up with a coalition of groups aligned with reproductive rights advocates and the democratic party to fund a large scale advertising and grassroots campaign for mccaffery planned parenthood votes the organization s political arm is running a seven figure ad buy in support of mccaffery its largest ever investment in a state supreme court race it is buoyed by a six figure ad buy from the democratic legislative campaign committee as well as grassroots efforts to turn out voters from labor unions

the architect of a fake electors scheme in accepting plea deals in exchange for agreeing to testify in the trial of the other 15 defendants a fourth co defendant atlanta businessman scott hall also pleaded guilty trump has the indictment a witch hunt the requirement that ellis powell and chesebro provide truthful testimony in exchange for reduced sentences bodes ill for the former president and others involved in the election theft effort including trump s personal attorney rudy giuliani and conservative lawyer john eastman even worse for trump and his co defendants ellis is also required as part of her plea deal to provide additional recorded statements and affidavits to the state and any requested documents or evidence while also participating in interviews with prosecutors and assisting in pretrial matters the string of guilty pleas also drives home why legal experts have long pointed to the georgia case as the one trump a master of escaping accountability may not be able to run from the state s racketeering laws the foundation of the case are notoriously strong and willis prosecution is beyond the reach of trump s allies in the federal government ellis powell and chesebro were not bit players in the campaign to overturn the election they were key actors involved in meetings strategy and communications with the biggest targets of the indictment all three of them especially ellis have direct knowledge of the scheme concocted by trump giuliani and others to steal the election the importance of ellis plea deal was immediately clear during her tear filled statement to the court on tuesday when she admitted her statements that the election had been stolen from trump were false and implicitly pointed the finger at giuliani as the reason why she believed the election fraud lie i relied on others including lawyers with many more years of experience than i to provide me with true and reliable information especially since my role involved speaking to the media and to legislators in various states ellis said giuliani is also implicated as the defendant whom ellis admitted to aiding and abetting in the false statements in order to solicit the appointment of illegal electors guiliani for his part has the indictment a travesty and an attack on the american people that effort is detailed in the indictment as 10 separate acts that ellis engaged in alongside giuliani to spread lies about the election in the press and before state legislatures in arizona georgia michigan and pennsylvania with the intent to get republican lawmakers to reject their state election results and instead send alternate slates of electors to congress that would flip the electoral college count in trump s favor her actions included soliciting lawmakers to illegally appoint electors for trump at committee hearings and in private meetings including one held at the white house with trump giuliani and then white house chief of staff mark meadows who is also charged in the georgia case ellis participation in these efforts means that she was privy to meetings phone calls emails and other communications that went into the strategy and execution of the plot to overturn the election by blaming giuliani who as a former u s attorney is a lawyer with many more years of experience than her ellis testimony can provide direct testimony about the former new york city mayor s actions and thought process in the weeks after biden won and leading up to the jan 6 2021 riot at the u s capitol she was also in communication with trump in particular at a nov 25 2020 white house meeting which also included giuliani and meadows when the effort to overturn pennsylvania s election results was discussed with state gop legislators powell who spouted absurd lies about electronic voting machines operated by dominion voting systems was also engaged in communications with trump as part of his elite strike team she not only participated in but also met with trump on multiple occasions including once when she tasked with investigating election fraud and seizing voting machines trump was dissuaded from giving broad powers to powell but she pursued other avenues

operations forces against the islamic state and served in fallujah iraq during some of the most heated urban combat there according to a u s official who was not authorized to discuss glynn s role and spoke on the condition of anonymity glynn will also be advising on how to mitigate civilian casualties in urban warfare the official said israel is preparing a large scale ground operation in an environment in which hamas militants have had years to prepare tunnel networks and set traps throughout northern gaza s dense urban blocks glynn and the other military officers who are advising israel have experience that is appropriate to the sorts of operations that israel is conducting national security council spokesman john kirby said monday the advisers will not be engaged in the fighting the

becoming a wider war it also is who in the last few days have come under repeated attacks that the pentagon has said were likely endorsed by iran kirby said iran was in some cases actively facilitating these attacks and spurring on others who may want to exploit the conflict for their own good or for that of iran we know that iran s goal is to maintain some level of deniability here but we re not going to allow them to do that the white house said president spoke with israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu on monday to update him on u s support for israel and ongoing efforts at regional deterrence to include new u s military deployments on monday the u s military garrison at an tanf syria came under attack again this time by two drones the drones were shot down and no

200 people in israel who were taken hostage in the oct 7 attacks started soon after the hamas operation the official noted arranging for the release of the raanans took longer to come together than

a federal investigation that sent cohen to federal prison he is also a major prosecution witness in trump s separate manhattan hush money criminal case scheduled for trial next spring james has credited cohen as the impetus for her civil investigation which led to the fraud lawsuit and trial she cited cohen s testimony to congress in 2019 that trump had a history of misrepresenting the value

behalf at a vigil in illinois for wadea al fayoume a 6 year old palestinian american killed by his landlord in what police say was a fit of mourners during part of syed s remarks but other clips show

solely at hamas militants and the israeli siege of the coastal enclave alexis zeidan a palestinian american activist in dearborn who was present at the oct 16 meeting grades biden s handling of the

donald trump s 17 in 2020 biden won michigan by but polling shows a in the state in 2024 even if i am the vote that will decide whether biden is president or not i will not vote for biden even if that means trump becomes president again said adam abusalah a palestinian american in dearborn who attended the meeting we feel like he has betrayed us time and time again we are told to choose the lesser of two evils the lesser of two evils added abusalah who was a fellow on biden s 2020 campaign and served as communications director to rep shri thanedar d mich but now more than ever it s clear that the lesser of two evils doesn t work siblani abusalah and zeidan all said that there is nothing that biden can do to redeem himself in their eyes ahead of the presidential election not only are you seen as a failed leader you are now seen as a murderer zeidan said and i don t think there s any reduction from that people s lives matter dabajeh offers only one unlikely circumstance in which biden could win back his vote the immediate recognition of a palestinian state along israel s pre 1967 border abbas alawieh a former chief of staff to left wing rep cori bush d mo who recently returned to his hometown of dearborn is not willing to write biden off yet as a survivor of the january 6 attack on the capitol i know the kind of hate that the modern day republican party is fueling in our country so this is a particularly difficult moment for me as a democrat said alawieh who is calling for a cease fire between israel and hamas my support is conditional on whether federal and statewide elected officials decide to take a different route a route that embraces peace a route that embraces saving lives as it relates to middle east policy though muslims have grasped the most political power in michigan their growing population there were just 2 4 million muslims in the united states in 2007 compared with nearly 3 45 million in 2017 means they have increased political power in multiple other states including minnesota virginia and new jersey the growing population has also led to growing political prominence and to increased familiarity with other americans americans who know a muslim are more likely to have a favorable view of muslims overall according to a in march to know arab and muslim americans and to see them in their full humanity helps people understand that our call for a cease fire is not a political position it is an urgent plea to keep us and to keep our families here and in israel palestine and in lebanon alive alawieh said in seeking to accommodate voters who want to see him take a more balanced approach to israel however biden faces political risks of another kind jewish americans with broadly pro israel views have long exercised outsize sway in democratic circles both through their activism and voting patterns and through their financial support for the democratic party in states including pennsylvania georgia nevada and arizona pro israel voters jewish and non jewish alike could play a decisive role in the outcome of the presidential election according to mark mellman a pollster who runs democratic majority for israel a group that has spent millions of dollars defeating strident israel critics in competitive democratic primaries and in new york where democrats hope to claw back four house seats that republicans flipped in 2022 pro israel jewish voters could be a key part of democrats plan to retake the house mellman said there s been a whole series of polls that all say the same thing the american people generally and democrats specifically are very much on israel s side in this conflict mellman said mellman for his part was skeptical that muslim and arab american activists would hold true to their anti biden pledge if the other choice is trump who on monday renewed his vow to re implement a ban on muslims entering the country as an analyst it s hard for me to believe that when you actually get to the presidential election more than a year from now and you have joe biden who has protected and advocated for civil rights civil liberties for arab americans against the guy who is a racist islamophobe and instituted a muslim ban for god s sakes it s just hard to imagine that people are going to go for the muslim ban guy he added

its offensive in gaza u s officials are privately telling some americans trapped in the region that the government lacks key pieces of information involving ongoing diplomatic negotiations and when it will be safe to exit in one case u s officials resorted to asking private citizens to use their own influence to improve the situation huffpost reviewed emails and text messages between biden administration staffers and an american family and their attorney the communications suggest there is confusion among personnel working on the sensitive issue a life or death matter for the estimated 600 americans currently in gaza on oct 21 the okal family made their third attempt to leave gaza through the territory s southern border with egypt at an exit point known as the rafah crossing by that point abood okal his wife wafaa abuzayda and their 1 year old son yousef had spent more than a week sheltering among a group of 40 people at a single family home 10 minutes away from the crossing they fled there after israeli authorities ordered gazan civilians to flee the north on oct 13 we ve been in touch with the state department since day 1 of the war nothing has happened okal said saying rounds of airstrikes made it impossible for the family to sleep at night his son has become more attached to his parents unable to be without one of them at all times and has taken to waking up screaming in the middle of the night from what his parents suspect are nightmares okal added the day they tried the rafah crossing for the third time they received multiple state department emails and messages saying they should try to do so rafah did not open for people to cross that day sammy nabulsi the okals lawyer pressed his government contacts on why that was the case if someone knows from leadership they aren t telling us a state department official who had been sending minute by minute directions to the okals wrote back to nabulsi via text in another email chain about the okals predicament a white house official called the situation incredibly complex and said the u s was working all of our channels to convince local authorities to allow people through rafah if you have connections that can influence in that regard i urge you to also send these messages to them the white house official continued a third official suggested to nabulsi that the u s had not adequately prepared before sending the alert to american citizens in gaza i have encouraged consular affairs not to issue any additional statements advising of opportunities to cross rafah until we have a clear yes from all three actors the state department official wrote in an email referring to a state department bureau and the authorities in egypt israel and gaza we re very close to agreement with two of the three and we are working the third very hard in an interview with huffpost on monday nabulsi blasted the biden administration i just can t understand how the right hand does not know what the left hand is doing at any given time he said both the secretary of state and the president are clearly prioritizing military aid to a foreign government the destruction of a foreign territory and frankly the killing of foreign civilians over the safety of american citizens nabulsi drew a contrast with the support provided to americans who were in israel after the palestinian militant group hamas launched a brutal shock attack in the country on oct 7 the u s government arranged more than 5 000 seats on specially chartered planes and ships to evacuate american citizens from israel and the occupied west bank as an american citizen it should not matter which side of the wall they re on nabulsi said conducting such an evacuation from gaza would be extremely complex amid active fighting but many aid agencies and some elected officials have said the u s could push the warring parties to have a humanitarian ceasefire there white house spokespeople did not respond to requests for comment for this story egypt has largely kept the rafah crossing closed this month citing repeated israeli airstrikes on the area three aid convoys have passed through in recent days though individuals are still unable to cross meanwhile israel has expanded its operation in gaza which the country says is aimed at wiping out hamas and allied militants on oct 23 israeli airstrikes intensified including on southern gaza near rafah where israeli officials had previously suggested gazan civilians should flee for shelter the latest round of strikes killed 436 people the majority of them in the south according to gaza s hamas controlled health ministry in total the current uptick in violence has killed more than 5 000 palestinians so far the health ministry says more than 1 400 israelis have also died since oct 7 according to the israeli government president joe biden s dominant focus on supporting israel and his opaque policy making process in regard to the conflict have spurred frustration across his administration particularly at the state department officials have previously told huffpost a u s official said government personnel tracking the gaza situation worry they will end up giving people false hope because of biden s approach nobody on our side feels they have any power israel has control of this situation said the official who sought anonymity to speak candidly the okal family has now reached an alarming deadline abood okal said in a monday recording shared with huffpost they have run out of milk for their son and have been unable to find more in local shops israel has cut off water and power supplies for gaza and tightly limited the provisions that go in from elsewhere the recent aid convoys through rafah carry only a fraction of what gaza previously imported daily according to the united nations while we ve been preparing for this day trying to wean him off it we haven t been able to do it because it soothes him and it helps him fall asleep as well as being his main source of nutrition as well as his comfort food okal said so we don t know what we ll do next okal s sister haneen and her three children including a baby are also with the group they are all u s citizens as well okal is focused on fleeing soon and is hopeful despite his three failed efforts to do so while we re sad for the people that we would leave behind the loved ones the friends all the civilians of gaza we at least have a chance to save our son he said nabulsi plans to continue pressuring u s officials to provide safe passage for the group and other americans and he says they deserve more guarantees from the biden administration as they await details on a possible departure plan he shared emails in which he asked officials to push israel to agree not to target areas in gaza where u s citizens are located on monday israel agreed to pause airstrikes on a section of southern gaza so the international committee of the red cross could help two hostages held by hamas leave the strip they ve never responded to me on that point nabulsi said if you aren t going to get them out you need to protect them hamas is not going to protect the american

and freshman lawmaker came despite the fact that on his watch inflation has surged into triple digits eating away at purchasing power of salaries and boosting poverty still he wasn t punished in sunday s voting with nearly all balots counted early monday massa had 36 7 of the vote and milei had 30 meaning the two will go to a nov 19 runoff most pre election polls which have been notoriously unreliable had given milei a slight lead over massa former security minister patricia bullrich of the main center right opposition coalition got 23 8 to finish third in the field of five candidates massa has been a leading figure in the center left administration in power since 2019 he successfully focused messaging on the way milei s proposals to slash the size of the state from halving the number of government ministries to deep spending cuts would affect everyday life for argentines said mariel fornoni of the political consulting firm management fit that had a significant impact and evidently instilled more fear than anything else fornoni said andrei roman ceo of brazil based pollster atlas intel whose latest survey had been one of few putting massa ahead said one key to the result was lower abstention than in the held in august around 78 of the electorate voted sunday some eight points higher than in the primaries that milei won milei a self described anarcho capitalist who built a groundswell of support while calling for elimination of the central bank replacement of the local currency with the u s dollar and a purge of the corrupt establishment that he called the political caste his radical proposals and fiery profanity laden rhetoric caused some argentines to vote for massa even if less than enthusiastically cristian ariel jacobsen a 38 year old photographer said he voted for massa to prevent milei s project that puts democracy at risk a sense of apprehension was evident on the streets of argentina in the days before the election people with any disposable income snapped up goods in anticipation of a possible currency devaluation recalling that the day after the august primaries argentines also bought dollars and removed hard currency deposits from banks as the peso accelerated its already steady depreciation massa s campaign this year follows another eight years ago when he finished a disappointing third place and was knocked out of the running this time he will have his shot in the runoff that contest will determine whether argentina will continue with a center left administration or veer sharply to the right massa 51 finished first in sunday s vote despite inflation surging to 140 on his watch and the currency tanking he told voters that he inherited an already bad situation exacerbated by a devastating drought that decimated the country s exports and reassured them that the worst was past he focused much of his firepower in the campaign s final days on warning voters against backing milei painting him as a dangerous upstart he argued that milei s plans could have devastating effects on social welfare programs education and health care the health education and social development ministries are among those milei wants to extinguish right wing support was split between milei and two other candidates whereas massa had already consolidated nearly all support from the left atlas intel s roman said massa sent a signal sunday night that he would seek to appeal to members of other parties for the runoff i m going to call for a government of national unity a government of national unity built on the foundation of summoning the best individuals regardless of their political affiliation he said he also could find common interest with other longserving public servants many of whom have bristled at milei s candidacy and the threats it posed milei who turned 53 on election day has characterized massa and others as part of the entrenched and corrupt establishment that brought south america s second largest economy to its knees today is historic because two thirds of argentines voted for change milei said in a speech sunday night at his campaign headquarters they voted for an alternative to this government of criminals who want to mortgage our future to stay in power he also has cast himself as a crusader against what he calls the sinister forces of socialism at home and abroad he opposes sex education feminist policies and abortion which is legal in argentina he rejects the notion that humans have had a role in causing that may have turned off some voters said benjamin gedan director of the latin america program at the washington based wilson center running as an anti establishment candidate milei was the undisputed star of the campaign so many people surrounded his vehicle as he approached his polling station that he needed a phalanx of bodyguards groups of supporters threw flower petals on his car there was this sense of inevitability around javier milei in the

council of the americas and now i think we have a really uncertain race it s going to be really tight in his speech sunday night milei appeared to try to appeal to those who may have trembled at his

being felt after night fell and authorities urged people to stay at home there were still families in shelters in cabo san lucas and san jose del cabo though officials did not say how many around 200

An expert on our modern political parties explains what’s behind the Republican Party chaos in Congress.,Paul Blumenthal,2023-10-21 00:00:00,on oct 4 a small group of rebels did what no one had done before and removed the speaker of the house from office in a mid congress floor vote these eight members led by rep r fla tossed speaker kevin mccarthy r calif aside and left the house speakerless for two weeks and counting subsequent efforts to find a replacement have failed first majority leader steve scalise r la won a closed door party vote to be the party s choice for speaker ahead of a floor vote but he was immediately rejected by the same rebels who overthrew mccarthy and he withdrew before he hit the floor then came rep r ohio a verbal bomb throwing hard line trumpist conservative who gained the backing of the rebels as well as mccarthy and scalise this time a coalition of appropriations committee members vulnerable new yorkers and enigmatic lawmakers teamed up to reject him three times now it s unclear what s going to happen next all of this may leave one wondering what the hell is going on in the house and more specifically with the republican party to answer this i decided to ask daniel schlozman a political scientist at johns hopkins university and an expert on political party history and behavior schlozman along with his co author colgate university political scientist sam rosenfeld has written a series of papers explaining to the point where they lack the ability to impose order on their elected members and the new right that prioritizes a commitment to conflict and the ruthless instrumentalism toward institutions above all else this research is the subject of their forthcoming book in a broad sense there is a faction on the right the freedom caucus that is interested in performative antics demonstrating their commitment to making trouble worried about leaders who will sell them out and not interested in the work of governing they have been empowered by a very very narrow majority and their tendencies have infected the whole party you combine the narrow majority and the tendencies which long predated trump and you get to the present mess i think it s worth going through the history the freedom caucus emerged from the tea party which rose as a right wing faction in the late 00s at the time the tea party was mischaracterized as small government zealots but immigration was really more salient and when donald trump takes office he clashes with the freedom caucus but they then become his most ardent defenders their consistent role has been being the big nasty thing making trouble for republican leaders that then takes on a much more public facing role with people like rep matt gaetz the libertine fox news attention seeking player as their most visible voices what s the route to power and success in the republican party today this is where fox news becomes so important as the vessel through which a lot of the wilder instincts are channeled as the entertainment complex that is leading the policy story rather than just responding to it the goes back to the 19th century but that particular manifestation is new through it you get matt gaetz going from an entertaining and mockable figure to getting some influence by being on television a lot to matt gaetz as the dry institutional actor it is more substantial than it seems republican leaders getting deposed in the house because they are not doctrinaire enough is a very very old story everybody does it bob michel by saying he won t run for reelection but it s very clear gingrich would challenge him and win doing it mid congress is really really new as is the fact that the world that has produced the rebels is not the right wing policy world but from the wild world of the right wing media complex that is what is distinctive about this figures like fox news have such a prominent role because the parties have ceded theirs to answer the question is to imagine an alternative universe in which there is much more gatekeeping against this conservative media complex in which republicans see the route gaetz took to success as this entertaining buffoon and say we will not allow that person in any way to dictate our strategy and so it is a story both of people like gaetz and also the story of why there aren t adults in the room why is it that the people who were supposed to come up with a responsible conservatism seem to have whiffed time and time again they never really get it they don t organize they play short term deals they talk about character and principles and that s nice to have individually but you have to organize together look at the incentives of the mccarthy disruptors you start by asking whether you are going to get the things you want in the house and what you can get are first policy outcomes second you can move up in the chamber just look at marjorie taylor greene serving as kevin mccarthy s lieutenant and whip this fitness instructor in her second term is doing what it takes folks decades to do and third you can aim for long term options like becoming a figure of influence outside of the house this is where you can see the rebels incentives because a lot of their goals are in a sense to be on television and to be an influencer more than they are to exercise power in the old fashioned way so the question is why is gaining influence in the right wing media and movement ecosystem the goal for the anti mccarthy rebels it s because you ve got this conservative movement that survives on antics they re not interested in governing this is what they re interested in you start with insights like those and the patterns we are seeing start to make more sense they see chaos as a strategy there s some substance concerns about who gave away what but mostly it is about why are we not using our control over the house for more performance and drama and confrontation mccarthy had not done enough of it for those who were toppling him as for jordan he can t make it because he s just a very factional figure take a classic congressional analysis and look at the that gives you a sense of a member s ideology within the chamber and jordan is in the 93rd percentile most conservative in the caucus it s just really hard to be that far out on an extreme the freedom caucus types have the power to dominate the conversation and to dethrone but at really just a basic level if you re going to govern you need to do so with the broad authority of your members it shows that while republicans are not a normal party in any way that some laws of standard issue parliamentary politics hold it s the job of the researcher to understand the motivations of the survey respondents not the job of the survey respondents to describe their own motivations and the second thing you re supposed to do is figure out what s actually motivating them no matter what they say every set of dissidents has a mixture of different motives whenever you say the speaker is too strong you can argue against the speaker s power and get support from other members who are restive and that s real but it s not enough to explain why they are rebelling now junior members always want more influence and complain about the centralization of power under the speaker but you ll notice that the rebels have not actually suggested a real alternative the institutional alternative to speaker power is committee power but they don t trust the committees which have staff they don t trust the committees are trying to do policy the staff is deep in these policy communities they may be beholden to interest groups what the rebels want to do is move power away from the speaker to themselves and their media friends and the movement so there s not really an institutional solution here there s some hope that there s some magic procedural trick that will give them more power than they ve got it s chaos for its own sake and it is creating narratives of betrayal that can be used down the line that we could have had this but for their perfidy those narratives are not really about what we could have had they are about the claim that others are insufficiently loyal to the cause that is the central dynamic that is going on as to the solutions because we can see the solutions are not going to work for them it s not worth going too deep down that road instead look at the narrative they re reproducing mccarthy promised us in january he wouldn t betray us and then he betrayed us just like they ve betrayed us before we are anti anti their opponents and we ve been sold out this is basically the same thing since joe mccarthy came up and said the state department sold us out and who lost china that they are not thinking like typical congresspeople is almost the point to say these guys are really powerful now and we re going to take them seriously does not mean we need to take them literally we have to think through what their power means for congress the american political system the republican party but that doesn t mean thinking through what their proposals are or that we need to write an explainer about them

scramble to reveal the truth show the perils of reporting on Gaza.,Matt Shuham,2023-10-20 00:00:00,this article is part of huffpost s biweekly politics newsletter click here to subscribe before considering what we don t know about the bombing of gaza s al ahli hospital this week let s consider what we do know around 7 p m local time tuesday an explosion occurred in the hospital s courtyard leaving what appears to be a small impact crater and setting off a large fire footage from the scene showed one vehicle flipped on its head and several others burned out more important the victims agence france presse correspondents on the scene saw dozens of bodies one man who responded to the explosion told the outlet he had collected the eyes arms legs and heads of the deceased in afp s words video confirmed by the associated press showed hospital grounds strewn with torn bodies many of them young children a palestinian red crescent paramedic told the new york times in an article published wednesday that there are still lots of bodies they haven t yet collected some victims unidentified and in pieces would likely be buried in numbered body bags he said one man abu muhammad al turkman lost five children and his wife in the explosion 972 magazine reported one of his relatives said al turkman was incapable of distinguishing one body part from another as he collected the pieces of his family according to the report yet another gazan sheltering at the hospital at the time muhammad al dahdar told the magazine it was dark and there was fire everywhere and a smell of blood and burned meat i felt like i was stepping on body parts i emphasize these grisly details first because they show the true nature of this conflict hamas military incursion and ongoing shelling aimed at israel and israel s ongoing airstrikes aimed at the gaza strip not to mention ongoing violence in the west bank have resulted primarily in the deaths of civilians and thousands of them second these details took hours or even days to establish reporting from the gaza strip is nearly impossible due to israel s airstrikes and ongoing blockade of the area trustworthy information is scarce numerous journalists have been killed in recent days when an australian broadcaster asked an israeli military spokesperson what sort of protection israel could provide to independent journalists in gaza so we can have a clearer picture he didn t directly answer the question so when the hospital was hit tuesday news organizations including huffpost which republished associated press reporting went with what they knew at the time in the so called fog of war that was very little palestinian authorities claimed an israeli airstrike had hit the hospital since then israel has rejected blame pointing to video footage that officials say shows a misfire from palestinian islamic jihad a militant group in the gaza strip some independent analysis may back up that view or more specifically that the damage at the hospital was not consistent with a typical israeli airstrike but the truth on either side is far from established eventually with israel s denials early headlines which blared that an israeli airstrike at the hospital had killed hundreds according to palestinian authorities were softened and further hedged reflecting the blame trading between sides the articles themselves largely made clear that news organizations hadn t confirmed key details including the death toll but the narrative had been set news consumers often just skim headlines some like reporter and media critic parker molloy argued that news organizations should change the structure of their headlines even though the initial headlines were true that palestinian officials were blaming israel molloy said such formulations amounted to a technicality and news organizations seeking readers trust ought to be clearer when they are merely relaying an unverified claim batya ungar sargon newsweek s opinion editor articulated the most extreme criticism nearly every legacy media outlet in the country eagerly swallowed a blood libel peddled by baby mutilating butchers just weeks after they committed a massacre because it allowed these journalists to recast jews as the perpetrators instead of the victims she wrote were the initial headlines misleading are news organizations obliged to report what they know when they know it should they have waited to include israel s denial should they have reported on the mere existence of a blast without mentioning the source at all unfortunately there will be ample opportunity to try answers to these questions as the killing continues but at least two key news outlets for what it s worth stand by their coverage during any breaking news event we report what we know as we learn it a new york times spokesperson told huffpost in a statement we apply rigor and care to what we publish explicitly citing sources and noting when a piece of news is breaking and likely to be updated and as the facts on the ground become more clear we continue reporting our extensive and continued reporting on the hospital in gaza makes explicit the murkiness surrounding the events there a reuters spokesperson said it was standard practice to publish statements and claims made by sources about news in the public interest while simultaneously working to verify and seek information from every side we make it clear to our readers that these are claims made by a source rather than facts reported by reuters in the specific instance of the fast breaking news about the attack on the hospital in gaza we added precise details and attribution to our stories as quickly as we could the associated press didn t respond to huffpost s request for comment ultimately the tragedy in the media back and forth was its success in turning attention away from the gazans hurt and killed by the explosion the same could be said for the wave of false claims that have spread on social media not only about this explosion but about other incidents throughout the war pushed by propagandists and shameless social media entrepreneurs both israelis and palestinians know how essential it is to document war atrocities the holocaust and the nakba are central elements of both groups respective histories and politicians from either side have pursued measures against denying that history the volleying over headlines this week is no doubt a continuation of that awareness of the desperation to keep count of the dead and assert the importance of their lives on the world stage but the israeli government has not acknowledged any error and its assertion is still public on its social media pages it is to omar and everyone else under a bomb or held hostage at gunpoint that my colleagues and i owe our loyalty i only hope we re up for the challenge

moderate and establishment members to support jordan a hero of the far right and help him for the gavel but as the pressure campaign devolved this week into death something unexpected happened positions hardened and a ragtag coalition of roughly 20 house rose up to jordan the speakership in doing so they defied a belief of many in washington that moderates have no backbone bullying don t work said rep don bacon a republican centrist who has led the opposition to jordan s nomination still bacon said the harassing text messages and phone calls have taken a toll other republicans said their families have been threatened and every lawmaker who voted against jordan has received a barrage of angry phone calls and messages still they vowed thursday to not back down as jordan tried for a third day to win the 217 republican votes he needs to become speaker it s just the latest twist in the contentious intra party feud that has consumed house republicans since the unprecedented more than two weeks ago hopelessly divided republicans have been arguing for weeks over how to mend their fractured majority the death threats have only worsened the tension with lawmakers feeling their colleagues are partially to blame for the outpouring of bile after rep drew ferguson s family started receiving death threats for his vote against jordan the georgia republican said in a statement that he would not support a bully for speaker he said the threats were unacceptable unforgivable and will never be tolerated for ten months the ultra conservatives of the republican conference have driven the house agenda leveraging their position in the gop s thin majority to demand that their wishes be met kevin mccarthy struggled with them for 15 rounds in january to win the speaker s gavel and ultimately had it wrested away by hard right holdouts as republicans choose their next speaker however the just say no tactic is coming from new corners of the republican conference moderate gop lawmakers who represent politically purple congressional districts senior members of the house appropriations committee and loyalists to gop leadership figures like mccarthy and majority leader steve scalise many republicans were angered last week by how the freedom caucus seemed to once again get what it wanted by refusing to support scalise s bid for speaker forcing him to drop out and clearing the way for jordan to make a run jordan had several advantages the hard charging ohio republican who helped found the house freedom caucus had former president donald trump s backing as well as support from conservative commentators and influencers like fox news host sean hannity meanwhile jordan tried to win over more moderate republicans by casting himself as a unifier who would listen to their concerns he told his fellow republicans he would not take the speaker vote to the house floor unless he had secured 217 of their votes he quickly broke that promise scheduling a floor vote tuesday and forcing the holdouts to publicly state their opposition and face the political fallout jordan and his allies believed the public vote would quickly wear down their opposition rep thomas massie a jordan ally predicted at the time that the holdouts would be put through a meat grinder of pressure and cave by the end of the week i don t think any of these 20 have the stomach for forcing that vote over and over massie said that proved wrong opposition to jordan only grew a few more republicans voted against jordan during a second ballot wednesday and others suggested their support would soon run out the pressure campaign had backfired as soon as you try to influence by getting outside groups to try to intimidate in that nanosecond it s over said rep mario diaz balart a senior republican on the appropriations committee who helped lead the opposition to jordan jordan for his part has tried to stop the threats and pressure after rep mariannette miller meeks said in a statement that she had received credible death threats after voting against him wednesday jordan condemned the threats and called for unity stop it s abhorrent he said on social media but colleagues have watched for years as jordan and his allies denounced their legislative work while playing to the party s base they were unmoved this is a matter of picking the person who s going to lead your party said rep steve womack a senior republican who opposed jordan this is more interpersonal womack said he was done with jordan after he gave a tepid concession when scalise initially won the republican conference nomination for speaker though jordan eventually offered support for scalise womack felt jordan had given a dog whistle to the house freedom caucus to withhold their support womack felt it doomed scalise s bid for speaker and he said he told jordan that his concession speech was the most unacceptable and egregious treatment of a fellow colleague i ve ever witnessed as republicans meet for hours on end trying to work past their grudges lawmakers are flailing for a path forward that would allow the house to once again do its work the white house is requesting wartime funding for allies israel and ukraine and the government will enter a shutdown unless congress passes funding legislation by mid november one senior republican rep tom cole of oklahoma said he sympathized somewhat with the holdouts they feel like they ve been pushed into a position where it seems to be the only thing these guys understand and so you start treating them the way they have been treating us he said still cole has also urged them to set aside those tactics to unite around a speaker the problem is you know that makes you feel pretty good but it doesn t get us moving any

But this time is different, experts say.",Marita Vlachou,2023-10-20 00:00:00,the unprecedented attack hamas waged on israel on oct 7 has been deemed a massive intelligence failure for the country s leadership and mostly the man at the top prime minister benjamin netanyahu netanyahu 73 israel s longest serving leader who has managed to reemerge at the top in the face of setbacks now appears to be at the center of a crisis of historic proportions that could likely lead to his downfall the fact that israel was caught off guard by groups of hamas militants who attacked towns and communities in southern israel and kidnapped hundreds of people stunned both the world and the country itself netanyahu s government has so far received most of the blame for the security failure polls show but the prime minister has yet to accept any responsibility analysts point out that israel s history suggests that its political leaders rarely remain in power after presiding over crises of such magnitude even if israel succeeded in its goal to crush hamas in this war experts say netanyahu is likely to be deemed responsible for creating the conditions that allowed the militant group to launch its brutal attack which has claimed the lives of thousands of israelis a dialog center poll last week showed 94 of respondents said netanyahu s government bore at least some responsibility for the absence of security preparedness that led to the oct 7 massacre while 56 of those surveyed said he should resign after the war is over meanwhile netanyahu s favorability ratings have dropped considerably with another poll by israeli research institutes last week showing that only 29 of respondents would now pick him as their preferred prime minister ehud barak who served as prime minister of israel from 1999 to 2001 hamas surprise attack on oct 7 was the most severe blow israel suffered since the day of its establishment asked if netanyahu who has served as prime minister for over 16 years can survive this in the long run barak said he shouldn t i think that in a normal place he would have resigned barak said noting netanyahu s responsibility given the attack happened on his watch in its immediate aftermath martin indyk a lowy distinguished fellow in u s middle east diplomacy at the council on foreign relations who served as former president s special envoy for the israeli palestinian negotiations from july 2013 to june 2014 the country is facing a challenge of unknown proportions the prime minister is facing a real problem not only in defending the citizens but in avoiding blame for what happened indyk said and i don t see how he can so he s got to find a way to redeem himself through the conflict amotz asa el a research fellow at shalom hartman institute told huffpost netanyahu has no options regardless of what he may want to do to weather this crisis there is no way that an israeli leader will survive this kind of debacle asa el said asa el cited the example of former israeli leaders who had to resign over their handling of crises including golda meir who stepped down following the end of the yom kippur war israel was caught off guard by a surprise two front attack led by egypt and syria in 1973 on the holiest day of the jewish calendar to regain territory while israel ultimately won the war which lasted 19 days the event traumatized israelis and the current conflict has so far killed over 1 400 israelis most of whom are civilians the death toll could likely rise as the war continues and israel to launch a ground offensive in gaza netanyahu has also had to confront the issue of the over 200 people hamas has taken hostage many israelis have calling out netanyahu over the kidnappings and urging him to take action to secure the freedom of those captured rear adm daniel hagari a spokesperson for israel s defense forces on thursday they have now notified the families of those identified as hostages but said the number may not be final the kidnappings of hundreds reportedly including children and older adults have also the extent of israel s intelligence failure and led to the spread of a sentiment that netanyahu is ill equipped to remain on the job anshel pfeffer a journalist for haaretz that the outrage previously directed at netanyahu over a controversial judicial overhaul has only risen in the wake of this crisis and the hostages families are becoming the focal point for that anger zehava eshel that soldiers like her missing granddaughter who was stationed near the fence that encircles the gaza strip were supposed to be the eyes of the country but no one listened when they said they saw unusual movements at the border netanyahu sees the writing on the wall mazal mualem a columnist for al monitor s israel pulse who recently wrote a biography of netanyahu and is now focused on damage control mualem said in my opinion he understands that he won t be able to continue after such a devastating failure and therefore he is focused on achieving military and diplomatic success during this war asa el said netanyahu s inevitable downfall would come not just as a result of the oct 7 attack itself but also because he displayed poor judgment over the hamas threat and his relentless pursuit of the politics of division he explains that netanyahu had effectively adopted a policy of containment towards hamas which turns out was all along a very implacable enemy as the economist netanyahu championed the idea that the threat of hamas in gaza could be managed by erecting a high tech border barrier instead of by seeking a long term solution and improving conditions in gaza they added that concept failed miserably on october 7th asa el told huffpost that netanyahu s attitude of put to sleep the military establishment which did not recognize the scale of danger the palestinian militant group posed to israel led to the attack earlier this month netanyahu has repeatedly divided israeli society for his own political needs asa el added and israelis will hold him accountable for that once the fighting ends netanyahu was on corruption charges in 2019 which he has vehemently denied the trial started in may 2020 but has since been delayed several times if convicted netanyahu could face several years in prison but a verdict isn t expected anytime soon his victory in the november 2022 election after allying with ultraconservative parties led to the creation of one of the most right wing governments in israel s history since his return to power netanyahu has pushed through a that critics say will harm israeli democracy by limiting the judicial system s power effectively the only system of checks and balances on the government with thousands of people taking to the streets to protest it some have also pointed out that netanyahu s main motivation for going ahead with the reform is it could help him avoid potentially facing accountability in his corruption trial yossi mekelberg an associate fellow with the middle east and north africa programme at chatham house predicted protests will likely return to israel s streets eventually only this time they won t just be about netanyahu s threat to democracy but also about how mr security fell asleep on guard duty mekelberg called netanyahu s decision to stack his cabinet with people of either limited or no military experience at all following his election win criminal neglect he explains that netanyahu s picks for crucial ministerial positions were below par for a country like israel where security is a priority and should be treated as such shirel hogeg a corporate executive at nestlé from the southern israeli city of ofakim who went viral for confronting a minister over the government s response to the crisis echoed mekelberg calling out netanyahu for giving important jobs to political allies in far right and orthodox jewish political parties netanyahu the corrupt the very corrupt who has been in the seat too long he s given out all these titles to cronies to survive hogeg he s given out funds to everybody to survive he has even given hamas money for the past 20 years to avoid confrontation and he never confronted them until the end since hamas offensive netanyahu created an to lead the war effort which includes several centrist opposition figures including former defence minister benny gantz while the newly created war cabinet does not include any members of the far right parties netanyahu formed a coalition with they remain a part of his government mekelberg told huffpost that this is a political calculation by netanyahu given that he will need their support to remain in power if any opposition figures drop out of the unity government mekelberg said he found it shocking that netanyahu was still in power despite this colossal failure also noting that the israeli prime minister hasn t accepted any degree of responsibility for the hamas attack even as others around him including ministers and defense officials have we have to admit honestly painfully and with a bowed head we the state leadership and the security establishment have failed in maintaining the security of our citizens israeli finance minister bezalel smotrich a partner in netanyahu s government ronen bar who leads the country s domestic intelligence organization also given his organization did not put out a warning that could have prevented the attack a released friday by the maariv newspaper showed that 80 of respondents want netanyahu to publicly accept responsibility for the oct 7 massacre mekelberg said netanyahu likes to take credit when things go right but blames others when events take a bad turn but the scale of this failure will not allow netanyahu to remain in the post for long he estimates do i expect him to resign in the manner of taking responsibility and give a big speech and say you know i had my time i failed you thank you and disappear into the sunset no i don t think so mekelberg said will he be pushed out in one way or another he asked i believe so

00:00:00,washington ap fifty years after the 1973 arab oil embargo the current crisis in the middle east has the potential to disrupt global oil supplies and push prices higher but don t expect a repeat of the catastrophic price hikes and long lines at the gasoline pump experts say the israel hamas war is definitely not good news for oil markets already stretched by and expected stronger demand from china the head of the international energy agency said markets will remain volatile and the conflict could push oil prices higher which is definitely bad news for inflation fatih birol executive director of the paris based iea told the associated press developing countries that import oil and other fuels would be the most affected by higher prices he said international benchmark brent crude traded above 91 a barrel on thursday up from 85 per barrel on oct 6 the day before hamas attacked israel killing hundreds of civilians israel immediately launched airstrikes on gaza destroying entire neighborhoods and killing hundreds of palestinian civilians in the days that have followed fluctuations since the attack pushed oil prices as high as 96 the price of oil depends on how much of it is getting used and how much is available the latter is under threat because of the hamas israel war even though the gaza strip is not home to major crude production one worry is that the fighting could lead to complications with iran home of some of the world s largest oil reserves its crude production has been constrained by international sanctions but oil is still flowing to china and other countries in order to get a sustained move in prices we really would need to see a supply disruption said andrew lipow president at lipow oil associates a houston based consultant any damage to iranian oil infrastructure from a military strike by israel could send prices jumping globally even without that a shutdown of the strait of hormuz that lies south of iran could also shake the oil market because so much of the world s supplies goes through the waterway until something like that happens the oil market is going to be like everyone else monitoring the events in the middle east lipow said one reason 1970s style gas lines are unlikely u s oil production is at an all time high the u s energy information administration an arm of the energy department reported that american oil production in the hit 13 2 million barrels per day passing the previous record set in 2020 by 100 000 barrels weekly domestic oil production has doubled from the first week in october 2012 to now the energy crisis of 1973 taught us many things but in my mind the most critical is that american energy strength is a tremendous source of security prosperity and freedom around the world said mike sommers president and ceo of the american petroleum institute the u s oil industry s top lobbying group in a speech wednesday marking the 50th anniversary of the 1973 oil embargo sommers said current u s production contrasts sharply with america s weakened position during the arab oil embargo he urged u s policymakers to heed what he called the lessons of 1973 we cannot squander our strategic advantage and retreat on energy leadership said sommers who has repeatedly criticized president joe biden s policies restricting as part of biden s efforts to with an unstable world war in europe war in the middle east and energy demand outstripping supply energy security is on the line sommers said in a speech at the hudson institute a washington think tank american oil and gas are needed now more than ever sommers said let s take to heart the lessons we learned from 1973 and avoid sowing the seeds of the next energy crisis for now the crisis isn t a repeat of 1973 arab countries aren t attacking israel in unison and opec nations have not moved to restrict supplies or boost prices beyond a few extra dollars there are several wild cards in the energy market one is the supply of iranian oil eager to avoid a spike in gasoline prices and inflation the u s has quietly tolerated some exports of iranian oil to destinations such as china instead of going all in on sanctions aimed at iran s nuclear program if iran which has warned israel not to undertake a ground offensive escalates the gaza conflict including a possible attack by hezbollah militants in lebanon supported by iran that might change the u s stance if the u s were then also to enforce the oil sanctions against iran more strictly again the oil market would tighten noticeably say commodities analysts at commerzbank lawmakers from both parties have urged biden to block iranian oil sales seeking to dry up one of the regime s key sources of funding another wild card is how saudi arabia would respond if iranian oil is restricted oil analysts say that while the saudis may welcome recent oil price hikes they don t want a massive price spike that would fuel inflation higher central bank interest rates and possible recession in oil consuming countries that ultimately would limit or even kill off demand for oil a third unknown is whether more oil will reach the market from venezuela the u s agreed wednesday to on the country s oil gas and gold sectors after venezuela s government and a faction of its opposition formally agreed to work together on election reforms venezuelan production could increase in 2024 in the next six months however production could ramp up by some 200 000 barrels a day a relative drop in the ocean according to sofia guidi di sante senior oil market analyst at rystad energy wyoming sen john barrasso the top republican on the senate energy and natural resources committee slammed the u s action as a gimmick that appeases a brutal regime in venezuela joe biden

1980s the energy department said thursday it will seek offers to start refilling the oil reserve in december with monthly solicitations expected through may 2024 he eased sanctions on iran which funds

Mitchell,2023-10-19 00:00:00,the scholastic book fair is facing backlash for choosing to separate books on topics of race and gender from other books at its school fairs as right wing censorship efforts continue to sweep the country the renowned book fair which schools in the u s have hosted for decades announced an optional book collection in elementary schools containing 64 titles called share every story celebrate every voice the collection focuses on books with content on race gender and sexuality which are banned in some conservative counties and states books listed in the new collection include the abcs of black history a biography of ketanji brown jackson the first black woman to be a supreme court justice and a book by jojo siwa a singer and youtube star who announced in 2021 that she is part of the lgbtqia community according to npr critics of scholastic s new collection believe separating the books makes it easier for schools to exclude books from diverse authors pen america a nonprofit that focuses on books and human rights said in a statement tuesday that sequestering books on these topics risks depriving students and families of books that speak to them it will deny the opportunity for all students to encounter diverse stories that increase empathy and understanding and reflect the range of human experiences and identities the organization said in an environment of growing censorship publishers have a dual obligation to both fight it and to make books as maximally available as possible scholastic s new collection comes at a time when conservative groups have pushed numerous book bans in schools across the country claiming that books on gender sexual orientation and race contain inappropriate language and are an attempt to indoctrinate children progressives have regarded the ongoing book bans as censorship and an attack on free speech in response to the backlash scholastic released a public statement to clarify that they have not put all of their diverse titles into one optional case for book fairs the company said that the new collection only focuses on books on topics that are being targeted by active or pending book ban legislation specifically mostly lgbtqia titles and books that engage with the presence of racism in our country because scholastic book fairs are invited into schools where books can be purchased by kids on their own these laws create an almost impossible dilemma back away from these titles or risk making teachers librarians and volunteers vulnerable to being fired sued or prosecuted the company said it is also still possible for book fair organizers to request specific books from the collection rather than ordering the entire collection nbc news reported pen america urged scholastic to look into better solutions for books targeted by the book bans the nonprofit argued that scholastic isn t the only organization facing challenges posed by right wing legislation other booksellers teachers and librarians are too pen america said the nonprofit went on to accuse scholastic of accommodating these nefarious laws and being an accessory to government censorship through this collection pen america reported last month that there were 3 362 instances of book bans in classrooms and libraries across the country during the 2022 23 school year the bans removed more than 1 500 books according to their report the bans occurred primarily in florida but also in texas missouri utah and pennsylvania a liberal mom s political group called red wine and blue started a petition that has garnered more than 3 300 signatures in opposition to scholastic s new collection the petition continues to urge scholastic to remove the collection and put the title back with the remainder of the book fair by separating these books into their own collection for opt in scholastic is sending a message that the books are problematic and should be avoided they re taking the most extreme policies from the most extreme

communications at scholastic told huffpost we are invited guests in schools and we support the paths they have taken working with their communities to continue to bring kids access to books especially through fairs which creates the unique dynamic of kids being able to select books for themselves in a public statement posted to their website scholastic also admitted that the solution wasn t perfect

presidential front runner says the values actually were underestimated about a decade ago trump s companies sought appraisals of two of their properties in new york s suburban westchester county the and an estate known as seven springs according to documents and testimony thursday at the time the companies were considering what are known as conservation easements on the properties according to david mcardle an appraiser with the commercial real estate firm cushman wakefield a conservation easement is essentially an agreement to forgo development in exchange for a tax break mcardle said he was asked in 2013 to figure out what the golf course would be worth if 71 high end townhomes were built there and he got substantial input from eric trump who s an executive vice president at the trump organization of course eric trump has lofty ideas on value assuming the townhouses would easily sell for 1 000 per square foot mcardle wrote in an email to a fellow appraiser at the time eric trump subsequently sent mcardle suggestions of properties to use for comparison while arguing that none had close to the amount quality or kind of amenities of the trump course in briarcliff manor new york as mcardle settled on a value of around 45 million he and lawyers for the trump company strategized in email about how to present it to their client mcardle said thursday that eric trump may have had a more lofty value in mind but a higher number wouldn t have been credible the email discussion was a leadup to finally tell eric he should accept this value from the professionals mcardle testified mcardle then got a message from eric trump saying that he d spoken to one of the lawyers and telling mcardle to hold off sending the appraisal until further notice trump s financial statements went on to list the golf course at values sometimes topping 100 million according to james lawsuit the villas weren t built donald trump floated a historic mansion and 213 acre property that spans three westchester county towns after his development proposals met opposition he pursued an easement mcardle was hired in 2014 through a lawyer for trump s companies to evaluate seven

attributes to him and suggested a supposedly comparable spread a connecticut development where lots sold for as much as 3 million apiece he had a very high opinion of his property said mcardle who said he eventually advised in a phone call that seven springs was worth up to 50 million eric trump was included in and responded to emails arranging for mcardle to present his view a few months later

Date,2023-10-19 00:00:00,washington fresh off a visit to israel following the hamas terror attack that killed more than 1 300 israelis president pitched a 100 billion plan thursday night to help both that country and ukraine defend themselves as well as to provide humanitarian relief for the 2 million residents of gaza i know these conflicts can seem far away it s natural to ask why does this matter to america let me share with you why making sure israel and ukraine succeed is vital for america s national security biden said from the oval office in the white house only his second such address of his presidency history has taught us that when terrorists don t pay a price for their terror when dictators don t pay a price for their aggression they cause more chaos and death and more destruction they keep going and the cost and the threats to america and the world keep rising he said while biden has many times over the past year and a half explained his rationale for supporting ukraine in its efforts to fight russia s invasion this was his first time to do so in a prime time speech in it he drew parallels between hamas and russian dictator vladimir putin to make his case for military help for israel and ukraine hamas and putin represent different threats but they share this in common they both want to completely annihilate a neighboring democracy biden said he said he would send congress an urgent budget request on friday to fund america s national security needs it s a smart investment that s going to pay dividends for american security for generations he said biden detailed both his trip to israel on wednesday as well as his journey to ukraine eight months earlier he again emphasized his insistence in conversations with israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu that israel must abide by the laws of war as it carries out its military actions against hamas which meant safeguarding palestinian civilians who are also victims of the terror group israel has been pummeling gaza with airstrikes for the past week and a half and is expected to launch a ground offensive there in the coming days we mourn every innocent life lost we can t ignore the humanity of innocent palestinians who only want to live in peace he said he also reminded his audience of the tactics russian soldiers have used against ukrainians since the invasion began we ve not forgotten the mass graves the bodies found bearing signs of torture rape used as a weapon by the russians and thousands and thousands of ukrainian children forcibly taken into russia stolen from their parents he said it s sick and biden cautioned americans against both antisemitism as well as islamophobia at home amid so much anger recounting the story of wadea al fayoume a who was stabbed to death in a chicago suburb last week a little boy here in the united states a little boy who just turned 6 years old was murdered in their home outside of chicago biden said his name was wadea wadea a proud american a proud palestinian american family we can t stand by and stand silent when this happens the president s first oval office speech which came this june followed an agreement with house republicans that averted an unprecedented default on the nation s debt which likely would have triggered a global economic catastrophe on thursday night biden laid out his case for why it is important for the united states to continue its leadership role in organizing the multinational alliance on behalf of ukraine which he himself assembled in the wake of the february 2022 russian invasion kyiv still stands because of the bravery of the ukrainian people ukraine has regained more than 50 of the territory russian troops once occupied he said he reiterated his support of israel after hamas militants assaulted towns bordering the gaza strip on oct 7 murdering raping and kidnapping israeli residents he said his budget proposal would guarantee israel the qualitative edge the united states has sought to make sure it maintains over other militaries in the region biden s aid package will likely find strong bipartisan support in the senate where leading republicans have like biden said that helping ukraine repel putin s invasion was a cost effective way of weakening russia and keeping europe safe however prospects in the house are less certain even before the recent leadership turmoil in that chamber former speaker kevin mccarthy r calif was having trouble getting enough republicans to support more assistance for ukraine many in his caucus followers of coup attempting former president donald trump argued that the united states had no interest in that conflict trump himself long an admirer of putin for having invaded ukraine in the days immediately following the initial assault biden nevertheless urged congress to move quickly time is of the essence he said i know we have our divisions at home we have to get past them we can t let petty partisan angry politics get in the way of our responsibilities as a great nation he said biden returned from his 30 hour journey to tel aviv just after midnight on thursday while in israel he met with netanyahu other government officials and survivors of the hamas attack he promised israel again that the united states would support it as it fought to defeat hamas even as he against letting the current rage lead israelis into making mistakes the way americans rage after sept 11 2001 led to mistakes in the u s response he also said that everyone in israel and the occupied territories whether jewish or palestinian deserved security and dignity eight months earlier biden had traveled to ukraine to meet with zelenskyy that trip involved flying to poland and then finishing the journey to kyiv with a 10

surpassed industry analysts projections signaling the video streaming service s is converting former freeloaders into paying customers in an effort to bring in even more revenue also announced it s raising the price for its most expensive streaming service by 2 to 23 per month in the u s a 10 increase and its lowest priced ad free streaming plan to 12 another 2 bump the 15 50 per month price for netflix s most popular streaming option in the u s will remain unchanged as will it also raised its prices for subscribers in the u k and france the company added nearly 8 8 million worldwide subscribers during the july september period more than tripling the number gained during the same time last year when netflix was scrambling to recover from a downturn in customers during the first half last year the increase left netflix with about 247 million worldwide subscribers well above the 243 8 million projected by analysts surveyed by factset research netflix s financial performance also topped the analyst forecasts that shape investor expectations the los gatos california company earned 1 68 billion or 3 73 per share a 20 increase from the same time last year while revenue climbed 8 to 8 54 billion the company s stock price soared more than 12 in extended trading after the latest quarterly numbers came out netflix shares have increased by about 30 so far this year amid mounting evidence its video streaming service is faring better than most in a crowded fielded of competitors that is testing the financial limits of many households netflix has picked up more than 16 million subscribers through the first nine months of the year already eclipsing the 8 9 million subscribers that it added all of last year but it s still a fraction of the more than 36 million additional subscribers that netflix attracted in 2020 when the pandemic turned into a gold mine for the service at a time when people were looking for ways to stay entertained while tethered to home this year s subscriber inroads have been made centered in part on writers and actors complaints about unfairly low payments doled out by video streaming services such as netflix the company has been able to withstand the recently settled writers strike and ongoing actors strike by drawing upon a backlog of already finished tv series and movies in the u s as well as productions made in international markets unaffected by the labor disputes in an apparent effort to rebuild its library of original programming after everyone returns to work netflix said it expects to spend about 17 billion on tv series and films next year netflix s decision to abandon its long established practice of allowing subscribers to share their account passwords with friends and family outside their households has prompted more viewers who had been watching the video service for free to sign up for their own accounts the crackdown also has boosted netflix s in another way current subscribers can share their accounts with someone living outside their households by paying higher monthly fees we are incredibly pleased with how it has been going netflix co ceo greg peters said when asked about the password sharing crackdown during a wednesday video conference call he predicted more subscriber gains will accrue from the crackdown for at least several more quarters as netflix confronts more borrower households about watching the service s programming without paying for it the apparent success of the password sharing crackdown could now free management to focus on other ways to bring in more revenue such as a low priced option that includes advertising introduced a year ago netflix s decision to open its service up to commercials hasn t been a big boon yet but harding loevner analyst uday cheruvu said he believes that will change as advertisers realize that the personal information the company has gleaned from viewers entertainment tastes can help target their commercials at consumers most likely to buy their products in the same way internet powerhouses such as google and facebook have been doing for years peters said during the video conference call that netflix is already working with is ad partner microsoft to target its commercials more precisely i think the advertising potential of netflix is underappreciated cheruvu said the audience engagement with the video advertising there could be multiple times stronger than a social media platform in a shareholder letter netflix said roughly 30 of its incoming subscribers are opting for the 7 plan with commercials growth that is likely to attract more spending from advertisers the higher prices for netflix s premium plans also seems likely to divert more subscribers into the ad supported option the streamflation era is upon us and consumers should expect to be hit with price hikes password sharing limits and enticed with ad supported options said scott purdy u s media leader for kpmg

student made waves this summer with republican presidential candidate and florida gov but he was shocked to find himself on the republican party s radar during the first in the nation leadership summit in nashua new hampshire on oct 13 i don t know the full story he told huffpost in his first extensive interview on the subject i don t think i ever will after getting credentials early in the afternoon mitchell was able to watch remarks from presidential candidate and former new jersey gov chris christie at the event which was hosted by the new hampshire republican party he planned to listen to long shot candidate perry johnson next but mitchell said he was then approached by a woman calling him a known disruption and a democratic tracker a term for political operatives who record rivals on the campaign trail mitchell said the woman scuttled him into another room he was questioned by the woman and a man both of whom he believes worked for the national gop and not for the new hampshire republican party he said the teen found the accusations unbelievable people who know me they know i m not a democrat tracker mitchell told huffpost they know i love the civic process in new

incident with desantis back in july according to the politician s private security physically restrained and ejected the teen from a fourth of july parade at the new hampshire event mitchell was ultimately escorted from the building by a team of cops who he said were equally perplexed the press corps witnessed the end of the ordeal which was a spokesperson from the event blamed the situation on an overzealous volunteer in she and mitchell confirmed he was later allowed back inside where he caught some of desantis speech but left before the q a a spokesperson for desantis told the times we were not involved in that decision to remove mitchell from the event neither the new hampshire republican party nor the republican national committee which did not host or plan the event immediately responded to huffpost s request for comment an exchange between mitchell and desantis when the candidate waffled over a question about former president donald trump s efforts to subvert the 2020 election results desantis offered a limp answer about letting go of the past mitchell said he was surprised at how the politician stumbled on what he called one of my worst questions on the campaign trail mitchell told huffpost that desantis team has created an unnatural environment around the candidate i don t think a campaign functions vibrantly when your campaign is basically being run by seven billionaires from never back down he said referencing the political action committee supporting desantis when a campaign tries to shut down questions people are gonna take notice of that michell added having attended over 80 presidential campaign events in the past two election cycles mitchell said candidates should take their time getting to know the granite state s voters who often set the tone for the primary cycle new hampshire primary voters will cast their ballots in early 2024 after iowa voters kick off the primary season with caucuses on jan 15 new hampshire voters ask their questions and we vet candidates really well in my opinion mitchell said noting that he s seen question driven events like those from christie and former u n ambassador nikki haley resonate the most with voters a speech only takes you so far i mean you have to greet with voters after events and if you don t i guarantee you that s gonna hurt you in the granite state because it s an expectation he said we want to see you at your house parties we want to see you at town halls he continued meeting with voters talking with them taking their questions getting a selfie or two mitchell also warned candidates new hampshire is a very small state so when you piss off 10 people they are gonna tell hundred people it s a small state and word gets around while mitchell s intense political interests may seem like an anomaly for a teen he urged adults to include young people in serious conversations young people need encouragement from adults in their life to encourage them to engage in politics

00:00:00,washington rep r ohio on thursday evening found his quest to become the 56th speaker of the house exactly where it was when the day began awaiting another vote where he is expected to fall short of the 217 votes needed in between though he backed a plan to give more power to the temporary speaker who replaced rep kevin mccarthy r calif reversed course to back away from that idea tried to woo holdouts who opposed him and ultimately delayed a third vote on whether he should become speaker we made the pitch to members on the resolution as a way to lower the temperature and get back to work jordan told reporters we decided that wasn t where we re going to go now a third vote is not likely until friday after jordan this week amid opposition from more than 20 of his republican colleagues instead met for hours in the capitol basement at one point mccarthy reportedly yelled at rep r fla who led the charge for his ouster he loses his temper sometimes maybe it s the irish in him gaetz told reporters i m glad that we were able to throw cold water on speaker light gaetz said the house would likely vote again on jordan though it s unclear how jordan could prevail republicans have been leaderless since booting mccarthy from the speaker s office earlier this month with nobody to replace him as a result the house can t function as republicans fail to coalesce around replacements lawmakers increasingly wonder whether they ought to let speaker pro tempore patrick mchenry r n c run things but conservative republicans immediately denounced the plan to empower mchenry which would have to be enacted through a resolution on the house floor rep eli crane r ariz told huffpost his constituents don t want a temporary speaker they want jordan they want somebody that will represent them in a conservative honest truthful manner crane said jim jordan is my choice and 87 of my district wants jim jordan as speaker rep marjorie taylor greene r ga also blasted the proposal describing the house republican conference as absolutely broken another far right republican rep troy nehls r texas said the fresh chaos only bolstered his case for giving the speaker s gavel to former president donald trump trump under republicans own rules given his multiple criminal indictments but nehls dismissed that as unimportant the resolution empowering mchenry gets at the heart of the problem facing republicans it would pass with democratic votes and if it did the house could pass legislation something many lawmakers consider urgent since the federal government faces a funding deadline and war is breaking out in the middle east but passing bills with democratic support was what got mccarthy fired in the first place because a faction of republicans refuses to accept that democratic control of the senate and the white house gives democrats an equal say in governance nehls expressed disgust at the idea of empowering a temporary speaker through a bipartisan vote hey american people i just want to let you know you gave the republican conference the ability to lead you gave us a gavel you re begging for leadership nehls said but what we re going to do is we re going to lead by bringing democrats on board sickening quite honestly mchenry himself shot down another idea floated by republicans on thursday that he should take the position he did not need a formal vote to be able to allow bills to be considered and other things a regular speaker can do on thursday night mchenry told reporters he thought a resolution to empower him was within house rules but simply acting as if he already had such authority was not i wanted people to be clear though that some other alternative here is something that i believe is unconstitutional and not conforming with house rules furthermore that i would not participate in any attempt to make that type of change mchenry said mchenry did not confirm that he had threatened to resign rather than act as speaker without a formal vote to give him power but he left little doubt where he stood if there is some goal to subvert the house rules to give me powers without a formal vote i will not accept it he said republicans will continue to argue among themselves for the foreseeable future house democratic leader hakeem jeffries d n y said after a party meeting thursday morning that democrats had come to no agreement on how they would treat an offer to boost mchenry if republicans needed their votes or what their price would be if any to provide that help the most important issue is making sure that we have an enlightened legislative agenda that we can act on with up or down votes that meet the needs of the american people he told huffpost the powers that mchenry has now as speaker pro tempore are subject to debate the house rule that made mchenry the acting speaker limits him to exercising such authorities of the office of speaker as may be necessary and appropriate to get a permanent speaker elected democrats have contended that mchenry s power is limited because the rule was adopted in the wake of the 9 11 terror attacks when lawmakers were worried about a mass casualty event that could impair congress and result in it being unable to meet some republicans are also wary of interpreting the rule as allowing for a strong acting speaker mchenry has mostly kept his duties limited to opening and closing the house chamber and overseeing the floor votes to elect a new speaker closer to the weaker reading of his role jordan flopped in two house votes this week thanks to opposition from more than 20 of his colleagues some complained that they received threats and harassment from members of the public for holding out the upcoming supplemental spending bill with aid for israel ukraine and taiwan may force a resolution to the impasse while it will go to the senate for approval first it s unclear how or whether it could come to the floor in the house after that without some change in the current speaker situation rep jared moskowitz d fla said democrats would be willing to bail out republicans but they would need to see the details of any offer first obviously if there s a bipartisan path forward we expect to govern in a bipartisan fashion he said but moskowitz also left the door open slightly on acting without leadership s blessing if party leaders can t cut a deal i

Jon Tester, said earlier this month that he wants to see federal lands ""turned over"" to states.",Chris D'Angelo,2023-10-18 00:00:00,if gop senate hopeful tim sheehy wanted to know how advocating for transferring control of federal lands to states goes over in a place like montana all he had to do was look at the last republican to take a run at democratic sen jon tester rep matt rosendale r mont found out during his 2018 bid for senate that it is an appallingly unpopular position rosendale embraced federal land transfer as a candidate for the house in 2014 going as far as to call for a montana takeover of all forest service and bureau of land management lands within montana s borders at a republican debate that year he dismissed federal lands as unconstitutional and said i believe that the citizens of montana should have control and management of those areas instead of the federal government but by the time rosendale ran for senate four years later he d clearly heard an earful from his constituents in a billings gazette op ed in april 2018 he wrote i ve listened to the people of montana and they mean business about protecting our public lands opposing a federal lands transfer he added a section to his campaign website titled protect our public lands in which he declared his belief that our public lands must always stay in public hands and during a candidate rosendale acknowledged that there was a time when i thought they could be better managed by the state but said he talked to people all over the state and they ve made it exceedingly clear that they do not want those lands transferred and i not only understand that i agree with that montana is 35 federally owned poll after poll shows that voters in western states including montana overwhelmingly oppose transferring control or selling off federal lands none of this has kept sheehy a decorated military veteran and millionaire businessman from making the same mistake as rosendale local control has to be returned sheehy told the working ranch radio show earlier this month whether that means you know some of these public lands get turned over to state agencies or even counties or whether those decisions are made by a local landlord instead of by you know federal fiat a few thousand miles away local control will almost always produce better results than a federal mandate from bureaucrats who are unaccountable to the people that are ultimately subject to these regulations while federal agencies are headquartered in washington d c most land management decisions are made by local field offices in that same radio interview sheehy condemned federal agencies specifically the bureau of land management and the department of agriculture accusing them of being hijacked in many cases by bureaucrats who are carrying out a political agenda and he railed against efforts to put additional federal lands into conservation in may the blm unveiled a draft rule that would place conservation on equal footing with energy development and other traditional uses including by granting the agency the authority to issue conservation leases to promote land protection and ecosystem restoration cattle ranchers have pushed back against the proposal saying it would upend land management in the west instead of supporting the producers that they re supposed to be enabling they are putting constrictions in place that could potentially put them out of business sheehy said so taking some of these leases you know out of agricultural production and moving them into conservation is deeply concerning we re seeing battles take place all over the country from nevada to washington to montana about what that really means the most famous battle over land rights in nevada was the 2014 armed standoff that notorious rancher cliven bundy led in bunkerville over fees he refused to pay for grazing cattle on federal lands it is not clear if sheehy was referring to that incident his campaign did not address several of huffpost s specific questions the bundy family has long advocated for a state takeover of federal lands sheehy himself is a fledgling rancher in 2020 he and his friend former navy seal greg putnam started the little belt cattle company in martinsdale montana today the company actively ranches approximately 30 000 private and leased acres and owns 2 000 cattle sheehy is digging in on a position he outlined early in his bid to flip tester s seat on his campaign website sheehy that he has a unique perspective on what the federal government is failing to address when it comes to tackling wildfires they need to let montana start managing our federal lands federal acres belong to all americans not just residents of the state where they are located western voters have made their views on pawning off public lands abundantly clear released in 2017 a poll by the center for american progress found that 64 of donald trump voters opposed privatizing or selling off public lands a by colorado college in 2016 found that 60 of voters in seven western states including 59 of montanans opposed selling off significant federal land holdings and a 2016 by colorado based conservation group center for western priorities found that 63 of montana voters would be less likely to vote for a candidate who supported selling public lands to reduce the budget deficit compared with 20 who said they d be more likely to support such a candidate aaron weiss deputy director at the center for western priorities told huffpost that the issue became such a third rail that candidates across the west generally stopped going there and pollsters largely quit posing such direct questions it s incredibly consistent over the years and not even close he said of public opposition this is not like an issue that is on the margin for montana voters they are very clearly against transferring or selling off public lands weiss stressed that transferring control of federal lands to states would ultimately lead to their privatization states and counties have to run balanced budgets and we know the amount of money that the federal government spends just on firefighting alone on national public lands would bankrupt just about every western state he said that s not even getting into the other land management costs that go into managing large swaths of public land in keeping them public the inevitable outcome of any of these land transfer proposals as much as folks try to frame them as oh this is just going to be a state issue inevitably it leads to selling off and privatizing public lands because there is no way for states to handle the management costs he added full stop both the montana republican party and national republican party platforms support transferring federal acres to the states sheehy may simply be towing the party line something he has gotten quite good at since launching his campaign in june but he is likely to soon find out just how problematic his recent comments can be for someone seeking political office in big sky country

with arab leaders after a deadly explosion at a gaza hospital killed hundreds the white house confirmed while biden was preparing for takeoff from washington that he now only plans to visit israel the amman summit was scrapped after palestinian leader mahmoud abbas withdrew in protest of the explosion which the hamas run health ministry in gaza blamed on an israeli airstrike the israeli military said it had no involvement and pinned the blame on a misfired palestinian rocket this war and this aggression are pushing the region to the brink ayman safadi jordan s foreign minister told al mamlaka tv a state run network he said jordan would only host the summit when all participants agreed on its purpose which would be to stop the war respect the humanity of the palestinians and deliver the aid they deserve while aboard air force one on his way to israel biden released a statement saying he was outraged and deeply saddened by the explosion at the al ahli arab hospital in gaza and the terrible loss of life that resulted he said he spoke immediately after hearing the news with king abdullah ii of jordan and israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu and said he has directed my national security team to continue gathering information about what exactly happened the united states stands unequivocally for the protection of civilian life during conflict and we mourn the patients medical staff and other innocents killed or wounded in this tragedy biden added white house national security council spokesman john kirby said officials haven t yet determined blame calling the situation very dynamic literally changing by the hour and adding that it wouldn t be appropriate for us to react to initial reports one way or the other we re not gonna get into the business of reacting in near real time kirby told reporters aboard air force one he said jordan declared three days of mourning after the hospital explosion and biden understood the move and was part of a mutual decision to call off the jordan visit the cancellation means biden won t meet with the jordanian king abbas or egyptian president abdel fattah el sissi but kirby said he d have an opportunity to speak to the leaders by phone as he returned to washington the quickly shifting events reflect an increasingly volatile situation that will test the limits of american influence in the region in israel biden planned to meet with netanyahu and other israeli officials as well as israeli first responders and the families of victims killed and hostages taken when hamas made its incursion into israel biden s decision to put himself in a conflict zone demonstrates his willingness to take personal and political risks as he becomes heavily invested in another intractable foreign conflict with no clear end game and plenty of opportunity for things to spiral out of control the high stakes presidential trip is emblematic of biden s belief that the united states should not turn back from its central role on the global stage and his faith that personal diplomacy can play a decisive role this is how joe biden believes politics works and history is made said jon alterman a senior vice president at the center for strategic and international studies who worked on the senate foreign relations committee while biden was a member by hamas that killed more than 1 400 israelis and triggered the unfolding war mediators have been struggling to break a deadlock over providing supplies to desperate civilians aid groups and hospitals as the humanitarian crisis grows so too does the concern of a spiraling conflict that stretches beyond the borders of gaza there have already been skirmishes on an iran backed group that s based in southern lebanon there s a lot that can go wrong on this trip alterman said biden s travels will be rife with security concerns and visits by other u s officials have been disrupted by rocket launches into israel additional israeli airstrikes in gaza could also prompt more condemnation at a time when biden is intending to demonstrate solidarity with the united states closest ally in the region maintaining full throated support for israel while slowly turning up the diplomatic volume on the need for humanitarian assistance in gaza biden and aides have heard increasingly dire predictions about the potential for images of suffering palestinians to ignite protests and broader unrest throughout the middle east kirby said biden will press israel to ensure that humanitarian aid reaches gaza as soon as possible and flows continually after that he said the president would seek to defuse tensions and try to ensure that the war doesn t trigger a deeper conflict he s going to get a sense from the israelis about the situation on the ground and more critically their objectives their plans their intentions in the days and weeks ahead kirby said of biden and he ll be asking them some tough questions he ll be asking them as a friend he added that the queries wouldn t be menacing or in any way adversarial u s officials nonetheless said it has become clear that already limited arab tolerance of israel s military operations would evaporate entirely if conditions in gaza worsened their analysis projected that outright condemnation of israel by arab leaders would not only be a boon to hamas but would likely encourage iran to step up its anti israel activity adding to fears that a regional conflagration might erupt according to four officials who spoke to the associated press on condition of anonymity to discuss internal administration thinking u s secretary of state antony blinken bouncing back and forth between arab and israeli leadership ahead of biden s visit spent seven and a half hours meeting monday in tel aviv in an effort to broker some kind of aid agreement and emerged with a green light to create a plan on how aid can enter gaza and be distributed to civilians it was on the surface a modest accomplishment but u s officials stressed that it represented a significant change in israel s position going in that gaza would remain cut off from fuel electricity water and other essential supplies biden has a long track record of showing public support for israel while expressing concerns privately to the israelis about their behavior he believes the only way to get inside the israelis heads is to demonstrate profound empathy but also to be there alterman said in the u s biden has won rare praise from republicans over his leadership on israel but prospects for providing additional aid are uncertain the administration has said it would ask for more than 2 billion in aid for both israel and ukraine has been ongoing for decades and to a large extent it s involved the same cadre of men

newest leader president since 2014 with tens of thousands of troops massed along the israel gaza border israel has been expected to launch a ground invasion but plans remain uncertain meanwhile the death toll is mounting israeli strikes on gaza have killed at least 2 700 people and wounded more than 9 700 according to the gaza health ministry nearly two thirds of those killed were children a
